  <h2 id='ch01' class='c005'>CHAPTER I <span class='c008'>⬩</span> ECONOMY<br />IN THE HOUSEHOLD</h2>
</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>June 20</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>You have no idea how your plaintive
little “wail” in the form of a letter
went right to my heart, or what memories
long forgotten it brought back to me of
my early married life. You are perfectly
right in thinking that I too had my “experiences,”
and I am so pleased that you
came to me to see if I could help you by
recalling what I actually went through
myself and what those “experiences,”
almost tragic to me at the time, brought
about in the way of remedies.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have no doubt that it will seem “like
a leaf out of your own book” when I tell
you that when we began housekeeping I
started, as a matter of course, in about
the same way of living that I had been
accustomed to in my mother’s house. This
was my standard and I knew no other.
What was my horror to find, when the
end of the month came, that I was taking
so much for table expenses that we had
little left for anything else. This discovery
nearly reduced me to tears, for we
had both been brought up as you have,
with a great dread of living beyond our
means.</p>

<p class='c011'>Our first thought was to move into a
house with lower rent, but, after considering
the question from all points of
view, we decided to remain where we
were and find some other way of cutting
down our expenses. This was a difficult
problem for any one so inexperienced
and who had never had to think much
about economy, but it was the very same
problem that you are facing in very much
the same way, and I did just what you
are doing, consulted a friend in whom
we had confidence and who had had years
of experience. This consultation encouraged
me to feel that there were many
changes I could make in our way of living,
and I was honestly amazed to find how
much that seemed necessary for the table,
just because I had always been accustomed
to it, was not necessary at all, but
that one was quite as well off without
it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I came home full of enthusiasm to see
what I could do. Then came a serious
settling down to the subject and a careful
looking into ways and means. Together
my husband and I talked over
his income and decided what proportion
we should allow for the table. The next
month was to be a practice month, carefully
watching how the money went, in
order to make a plan for other months.
How interesting it seemed! It meant that
I had a vocation as well as my husband;
that, by careful thought, I could make
him feel that it was worth while to work
hard if what he earned went just as far as
it could and if when he came home tired
he found my part attended to so well
that the home was comfortable and serene.
For why, if he went faithfully to
his business daily, as a matter of course,
in order to give me the wherewithal to
run the house, should not I do my part
as seriously and faithfully?</p>

<p class='c011'>From that time economy and the management
of the household took a new
interest, and what had been drudgery became
a fascinating puzzle. I plunged into
the study of good cookery books, learning
all I could about the different cuts of meat,
how to tell good fowl, etc., so that I
could choose well and make the money
go as far as possible. In this search I
discovered that the cheaper cuts of meat
are sometimes the most nourishing and
can be made tender by long cooking and
very palatable in various ways. I also
learned a great many different receipts
for cooking the less expensive vegetables
and serving them in an attractive way to
give variety with the least expense.</p>

<p class='c011'>I then started with my practice month
in this way: I bought groceries in small
quantities, only as much as we needed
for a few days at a time, asking the price
of things and keeping an account of them
to check off with the bill when it came
at the end of the month. Bills are a torment
with a small income, so, while I
found the bills for staple groceries, ice,
and milk almost a necessity, I paid cash
for all other articles of food; that is, meat,
vegetables, fish, eggs, butter, etc. I went
to market two or three times a week buying
and paying for everything on the
spot and seeing everything weighed and
measured that was sold in that way. At
the end of this practice month I made
a list of what we had used in groceries,
ice, and milk, and also added together all
the cash spent on the other articles of food.
With the grocery list in hand, at the beginning
of the second month, I laid in a
complete supply of groceries for the whole
month, keeping it in a storeroom and giving
out each morning enough for the day’s
needs. Of course some months we used
a little more, some a little less, but it averaged
pretty even and was a good guide.
I laid in laundry soap by the box, because
to keep a box ahead, if you can, is the best
economy, for it lasts twice as long if it is
stacked on shelves with spaces between
the cakes so that it can dry thoroughly
before using.</p>

<p class='c011'>The amount of groceries, milk, and ice
we should use per month having been decided
upon as nearly as I could, we divided
the <i>cash</i> I had spent on the other
food during this practice month by 30,
to see what allowance this would give me
per day. Then, when I went to market I
took with me in my marketing purse only
the exact sum we allowed for the number
of days for which I was marketing.
Otherwise I felt sure I should spend too
much, as the markets are so tempting and
human nature so frail!</p>

<p class='c011'>Luxuries we did not have; we were
young and did not need them and we
have never regretted that we saved them
in order to have them in our old age.
Finding fancy groceries expensive, I did
not buy them, but tried to put the money
we had allowed ourselves for the table
into nutritious food. Before going to market
I used to make a rough outline ahead
of the meals and take with me a list of
what was needed for them. One is much
more apt to have variety by thinking
ahead, and taking a list to market is an
economy, for, while one may change it
after getting there, and substitute one
article of food for another, still there is
less likelihood of getting unnecessary
things.</p>

<p class='c011'>Money spent on a few good cookery
books is well spent, for without their suggestions
one is apt to fall into a rut, and
this the family cannot forgive. No cook
left to herself does her best. She needs
constant supervision; to be told, “a little
more salt here,” “more sugar there,”
“slower cooking,” etc., and also to be
praised for what is good. If the praise is
not given, the cook gets discouraged; if
mistakes are overlooked, she gets careless.
As some cooks don’t take correction
pleasantly, however well given, you will
find that it works best to give it at the
end of your morning talk when all the
ordering is finished.</p>

<p class='c011'>In beginning with a new cook, it is
well to explain at once to her that you
want her to lay aside everything that is
left over, if only a tablespoonful, putting
it into the wire safe or refrigerator for
you to decide about the next morning.
This is not generally done by American
housekeepers, so that, at first, cooks are
apt to think you are mean unless you explain
to them cheerfully and pleasantly
that it is in order to have a greater variety
and that this is one of the reasons
that the French cookery is so good.</p>

<p class='c011'>You will find in some of your receipt
books about the French <i>pot-au-feu</i> and
can learn from this how to manage
your own soup pot, using the bones left
over from roasts, etc., to start a stock and
varying this soup each day with left-overs,
such as even a tablespoon of peas or
some spinach (strained), or string beans,
tomatoes, shreds of lettuce, or creamed
oyster plant. This may not <i>sound</i> especially
good to you, but my cook now
makes soups that surprise me by their
good flavor and variety in just this way.</p>

<p class='c011'>These left-overs also make good salads,
sometimes the basis being potatoes,
to which is added a few beets, a little
shredded lettuce, or, in addition, some
meat chopped up, each thing being too
small a quantity in itself for any one dish.
Thus, a hearty and good salad or a hot
dish is evolved from what many people
allow to be thrown away. I would advise
you to study some of the scientific
diet menus that are published now and
find out the relative values in nutriment
of the different foods. Among the ideas
of value to you you will discover that
there are many foods, such as cheese,
peas, lentils, and beans, which take the
place of meat. As, for example, one
pound of cheese equals two pounds of
beef in nutriment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Eloise is at my elbow imploring me to
stop writing and give <i>her</i> some advice
about her dress for Mrs. Blake’s fancy
ball, so I mustn’t run on any more.
Don’t hesitate to tell me anything that
troubles you, for it will be such a pleasure
to me if I can help you.</p>
<p class='c012'>Very affectionately yours,</p>
<p class='c013'><i>Jane Prince</i>.</p>
<p class='c014'>P. S. Some days, when you don’t feel
well, it is hard to think of the menu, so I
would advise you, whenever you have
tried a receipt and found it good, to write
in a blank book, kept for the purpose, the
name of the dish, the title of the cookery
book, and the page on which you found
the receipt; thus: “<i>Fish pudding</i>, Mary
Ronald’s Century Cook-Book, page 123.”
Before you know it you will have a book,
not of receipts, but of suggestions, which
will tell you just where to look for the
sort of dish you want for breakfast, lunch,
or dinner. In order to make it perfectly
easy to turn at once to any especial dish,
divide the blank book, before you make
any entries in it, into as many sections as
may be convenient, leaving several pages
to each section:</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c015'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>relishes</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>soups without meat</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>meat soups</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>fish soups</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>fish receipts</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>entrées</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>meats</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>vegetables</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>salads</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>desserts</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>lunch dishes</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>breads and cakes</i></div>
      <div class='line'>So many pages for  <i>eggs</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Can’t you imagine the relief such a
book would be in an emergency and how
valuable it would become after a while
because it has references only to tried
receipts?</p>

</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>July 30</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>Your letter came this morning
and you needn’t apologize at all for writing
me again so soon, for I am always
delighted to hear from you. It is very
evident that you have an attack of the
blues, so I am writing you at once—now
that I have a little spare time—to see if
I can’t help you out of them as quickly
as possible. Being terribly busy this
week you must forgive me if I plunge
at once into the subject and end when I
have said my say, without any bits of
gossip to enliven the letter. I will tell
the girls to write you all the latest news.</p>

<p class='c011'>It isn’t at all surprising that you
feel as though economy were drudgery
when you are simply trying to live on just
as little as you can with no other object
in view. What Dr. Richard Cabot says
in his book that you and I read together
is so true, “<i>Work</i> is doing what you don’t
now enjoy for the sake of a future which
you clearly see and desire. <i>Drudgery</i> is
doing under strain what you don’t now
enjoy and for no end that you can appreciate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that you tell me you have started
the plan of laying aside a certain sum for
marketing and find it works well, and that
it is interesting to see how far you can
make a particular sum of money go in this
department, I am encouraged to do some
more suggesting along the same lines. I
would advise you to take a quiet time,
when your husband is not tired, and together
think carefully over what all your
other regular expenses are, making a list
of them something like this: rent; service;
lights; fuel; ice; milk; cab and car-fare;
doctor’s bills and medicine; postage; incidentals;
presents; travel; charity; marketing;
groceries; your dress; your husband’s
clothes; amusements. <i>Some of
these items</i>, such as doctor’s bills and
medicine, belong to the unexpected and
you cannot make an allowance for them.
<i>Others</i>, such as light, fuel, milk, etc.,
after some experience, you can make an
approximate allowance for. <i>But there are
some</i>, such as rent, service, charity, dress,
etc., that you have under your control
and for which you can make a definite
allowance. Now, let us see if we can’t turn
drudgery into pleasant work. You have
already put aside a definite sum for marketing;
decide also upon a definite sum,
that seems reasonable and liberal to you
both, for some of the <i>other accounts that
are under your control</i>, and think what fun
it would be at the end of the month to
surprise your husband with savings from
any of these accounts and occasionally
to use this money for a little spree which
you both can enjoy, or for some much-needed
article for one of you or for the
house, or else to put into a nest-egg for
the future. You will find that you can
do this if you “cut your garment according
to your cloth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of course, in order to know just what
you have saved on any one item of your
account, you would have to keep a careful
record of everything that you spend, and
this you can do only by carrying a list
with you when shopping and writing
down at the time the cost of everything
you buy. At the end of each month separate
these expenditures, whether paid for
by cash or check, into their separate items,
adding all of one kind together under one
head, thus:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='33%' />
<col width='33%' />
<col width='33%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>Jany.</td>
    <td class='c006'>Rent</td>
    <td class='c007'>$45.00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c006'>Dress</td>
    <td class='c007'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c006'>Gas</td>
    <td class='c007'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c006'>Fuel</td>
    <td class='c007'>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c016'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c017' colspan='2'>Etc., etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c011'>Keep this statement somewhere, either
in the back of your account book or in a
blank book kept for the purpose, so that
you can always tell at a glance how
much you have spent any month on any
one item. This memorandum is very important
and should be a great help to
you, for, after several months of careful
watching you will begin to know about
how much you really need for your
different regular expenses. Sometimes,
after looking over the figures, you are
led to feel that you have spent more
than you ought on some one account,
sometimes on another, and then the accounts
have to be gone over to see how
you have been careless. Even now I
find it of use to look back on this memorandum
when money seems to be going
a little faster than it ought to. Each
family has to decide for itself what <i>proportion</i>
should be allowed for these different
expenses, but, with your income
of $2200 a year, it is safe to allow fifty
cents a day per person for all food. The
house rent, so business men say, should
not be more than a quarter of one’s income,
if possible a little less than that.</p>

<p class='c011'>Neither of you will feel happy, I know,
unless you lay aside something for your
church interests and also to help, if only
a very little, some of the public-spirited
efforts for good. You can’t improve on
the Biblical proportion of a tenth of one’s
income for this, or more if you are prosperous.
Some people could get almost
that from the waste in their households.
You can see how you could enjoy giving
when you knew just what you had
to give and were not worried with indecision.</p>

<p class='c011'>Above all things, be very frank with
each other in money affairs. Lack of this
frankness is sometimes responsible for a
man’s getting into debt because he can’t
bear to deny his wife what she wants
and she doesn’t know that he is living
beyond his means to get it for her. I
hope you won’t think me cruel when I
advise you to keep away from shops unless
you have something to buy; in fact,
waiting until you have quite a list, for if
one doesn’t see the fascinating things
one doesn’t feel the need of them. Bargains
are a snare and a delusion, and,
depend upon it, one spends less money
by getting something at its regular price
when one actually needs it than in getting
something very cheap to lay by
for a possible need which may never
come.</p>

<p class='c011'>I can understand your feeling perfectly
well that economy seems so mean, but
all danger of its being mean is removed
if you waste nothing on yourselves or
your household in order to be able to do
something better or wiser or more generous
with your money. We have nothing
but admiration of the French thrift
(we don’t call it economy), and why
should not we Americans follow their
example?</p>

<p class='c011'>You may have an income of your own
some day, and I shall venture to advise
you about that even if that beloved husband
of yours is looking over your
shoulder! I hope you won’t fall into the
mistake, on account of the love and confidence
you have in him, of putting it
into the common purse for regular expenses.
It doesn’t reflect at all on that
confidence to keep your own accounts
separate from his. The most devoted of
husbands and wives often differ in their
ideas of what they want to spend money
for, and many a good and kind husband
would soon begin to feel a right over his
wife’s money if it went into the common
purse, so long as he was spending it conscientiously
in the way he thought would
bring her the most comfort. In the first
glamour you can imagine how a wife
would enjoy the sacrifice of giving freely
all her possessions into her husband’s
care to control as he thought best, but
later she might awaken to such a sense
of the responsibility that the possession
of money entails that she would feel that
she ought to decide for herself how it
should be spent. To make the change
then would be likely to cause hurt feelings
or even a misunderstanding. For
a woman to keep her accounts separate
need never interfere with her helping out
at any time when she saw the need of
it, and that would be a genuine pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>If there is anything else you want to
talk over with me, now is the very best
time to write, for <i>all</i> my children are going
off on visits and the house will seem
so lonely that I shall be more glad than
usual to devote some of my time to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very affectionately, with apologies to
Tom for the last part of my letter,</p>
<p class='c012'>Your friend,</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c005'>CHAPTER III <span class='c008'>⬩</span> SERVANTS</h2>
</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>August 10</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>It has been so long since your
last letter that I feared you were ill and
was at my desk starting to write you
when yours came and explained the
whole situation. What a picture of misery,
and to think that that nice-looking
Mary turned out so unsatisfactory and
that you have had such a succession since
her departure! So you feel degraded and
as though there was something the matter
with you personally, do you? Well,
there is nothing the matter with you, and
you are the same dear girl that you have
always been, and with your willingness
to give the servant question all the
thought that it needs, these very experiences
will help you to cope with it more
wisely. It made me laugh to hear how
disgusted your husband was because your
present housemaid was such a fright!
Don’t let that worry you; just provide
her with neat white aprons and a cap
and he won’t know her. Tell him I wish
he had seen the little apparition that
came to me, when we were first married
(we were living in the South at the
time), in answer to my advertisement for
a housemaid. At least forty-eight tiny
little braids, each about four inches long,
stood straight out from her little black
head and she was clad in bright red plaid
from top to toe, her face beaming all over
with good nature. She looked clean, as
you say your new maid does, and the
transformation was complete when later,
with hair smoothed out, and in a neat
calico dress and white apron, she stood
before me for inspection. Since then, you
can imagine I have had all sorts and kinds
and so many experiences that I have
gradually grown to look at domestic service
in a broader way.</p>

<p class='c011'>You have had enough discomfort already
to make you feel that it is a serious
problem and I am so glad that what
you have gone through has only determined
you to come out victorious in the
end and not to follow the example of so
many women who go into apartments to
get rid of household cares. Undoubtedly
they do reduce the number of their servants
and their worries in this way, but
the family also loses much of the home
feeling. What would we think of our
husbands if, when the men in their employ
gave them trouble, they said to us
that they could not manage their employees
and would have to get rid of most
of them which would necessitate their reducing
their business and our living in
less comfort in consequence? Wouldn’t
we in our hearts think they were failures
in their vocations? And yet we women
are just as much failures in our vocation
when we give up the privacy and comforts
of home to go into an apartment
because we cannot manage our servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every woman who tries to bring about
a better understanding between herself
and her servants helps every other
woman to make home life more comfortable,
so it really isn’t a little thing to do.
On the contrary, if enough women try,
they may bring about great results.
Nothing is so absolutely destructive to
an understanding between mistress and
maid as the habit, so common and so
catching, of looking at servants as a class
by themselves, unlike other human beings
and antagonistic to their mistresses.
What we should do is to try to get into
a sympathetic mood by remembering
that human nature is the same the world
over and in all classes, the great difference
being in education, early surroundings,
and training. If we only keep this
in mind, while it really seems almost impossible
to understand the ignorance of
many servants and to see things from
their point of view, yet we may at least
realize that it would be a disgrace if our
ideals of conduct were not higher than
theirs.</p>

<p class='c011'>When I tell you that you will need
nearly every known virtue to keep house
well, you will expect to come out of the
experience a piece of absolute perfection!
Certainly <span class='sc'>Patience</span> is one of the foremost
needed. It is so easy and natural for
us to scold a servant when she has neglected
her duty or done something stupid,
instead of patiently following her up every
time she neglects anything and with a
pleasant but decided manner seeing that
she does it. And yet I know, from experience,
that the scolding produces no
result except to make her angry, while
the other method will have one of two
results; she will either get into the habit
of doing her work well to save herself
the mortification or irritation of being corrected
or else she will show you that she
isn’t worth training and that you might
as well let her go. One’s patience, however,
may cease to be a virtue in the case
of a sullen servant. I would not keep
such a one, no matter how good her work
was, if after having spoken to her about it
she did not change, for nothing will wear
you out sooner, and to no purpose, than
having to contend with that kind of a disposition.
Tell her the reason that you part
with her and perhaps she will do better
in her next place, in which case you will
have helped her and her future mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Unselfishness</span>—there’s plenty of
opportunity for a mistress to show if she
is sincere in her desire to be fair. Just one
instance: It isn’t very pleasant, to say the
least, if, after one has trained a servant to
be skillful and she has stayed for several
years so that one has grown dependent on
her, she leaves for higher wages. Yet in
every other calling people are praised for
what is called their ambition to rise, and
if we can’t pay high wages, how can we
expect to keep the most skillful servants?
And why should we make them feel as
though they were not behaving well when
they leave for more money?</p>

<p class='c011'>How much <span class='sc'>Wisdom</span> and <span class='sc'>Thoughtfulness</span>,
too, we need to keep all the different
dispositions in the house in harmony,
to know just the right moment
to correct and the time when extra work
or a rainy wash-day or a headache make
it wisest to delay correction.</p>

<p class='c011'>And then <span class='sc'>Moral Courage</span>—it is wonderful
how that often will win the day. It
is fatal to be afraid of servants. If you
have to reprove one of them that you like
and do not wish to lose, it is a good thing
to fortify yourself with the thought that
it would be better to lose her than to give
in to any unreasonableness, for that would
certainly put you in her power. You will
be surprised how the calm firmness that
this thought will give you will generally
win the day, if it is backed by the fact
that the maid knows she is in a comfortable
home and has a considerate mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>But I know you want me to talk about
your particular troubles, when there <i>was</i>
a comfortable home and a considerate
mistress. I can readily believe how
interested you were in making Mary
happy and that you wanted her to feel
that your house was her home, and I can
just picture how sweet and nice your
kitchen and her bedroom looked with
everything so neat and new. It was disappointing,
in return for all your thoughtfulness
of her comfort, to have her show
that all she apparently wanted was to get
away from her work as quickly and as
often as possible. And then after her departure
to have such a series of incompetents
in quick succession, each with
some new demand, was perfectly disheartening.
I do feel so sorry for you, for
I know just how discouraged you must
have been. Of course I have no way of
divining what the cause of dissatisfaction
was, but we always have to bear in mind
that there is so much of the antagonistic
spirit between mistress and maid that
those of us who do not have it, but who
want to be kind, have to suffer for those
who are unjust. At any time a maid may
come to us direct from a home where she
has had a hard mistress, who gave her
her outings grudgingly, didn’t like her
to have her friends come to see her, and
perhaps, while giving her an almost luxurious
room, rarely spoke a kind word
to her and took it for granted she would
be faithless and perhaps even dishonest.</p>

<p class='c011'>Or, she may have come from some
good-natured but thoughtless mistress
where her room was miserably uncomfortable
and where possibly she had to
share her bed, washstand, and bureau
with a girl whom she had never seen before
or who wasn’t clean. From such
places she would come to you naturally
in an antagonistic mood, and, suspecting
that she would not be looked out for,
make demands for even more than she
really wanted. She would make the mistake
that I have just advised you to
avoid, of classing all mistresses together
as unkind or thoughtless. Of course it is
very unintelligent to do this, for we might
as well class all lawyers or all bankers
together and expect no good from any
of them because some have such low
standards. And yet we can hardly blame
her when we ourselves have heard so
many mistresses talk of servants as though
they were all worthless. You seem to
think you might have come to some
agreement with Mary if you hadn’t been
so indignant at what seemed ingratitude
after all you had done for her. Possibly
that is true, but it is past now and it is
useless to cry over spilt milk. What you
can do is to start out differently with your
new maid in the light of your past experience.</p>

<p class='c011'>I think you will find yourself much
happier if you don’t look for gratitude,
for it isn’t to be found very much in any
class of life. Above all things, don’t let
what you have gone through make you
distrustful, for it is the part of wisdom
as well as of kindness to let the new
maid feel that you expect well of her. If
she has good stuff in her, that is the way
to bring it out. We ourselves show our
best side to those who believe in us.</p>

<p class='c011'>You seem to have a vague feeling that
Mary’s leaving you had something to do
with the outings she wanted. That may
have been so, for very few of us can
enter into servants’ lives enough to realize
the vital importance of their outings
to them. I can understand your being a
little distrustful of her when she wanted
to go to a dance, for I used to feel that
way myself, but I don’t feel so any longer.
Through interest in social work I have
learned to appreciate how important recreation
is to all classes and how natural
is the taste for dancing and the theater.
Of course, if a maid wanted to go
often, that couldn’t be allowed, for it
wouldn’t be compatible with good
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>While most of us are interested in
helping to give recreation to the less fortunate
classes, we have hardly awakened
to the fact that there is one class, that of
our servants, who are ridiculed if they
want it. It is really quite pathetic to
think how little appreciation we have
of their need of amusement, and how
many jokes are made at the expense of
those who want occasionally to go to a
dance or to the theater. You and I know
some people who don’t even want to let
them have their friends come to call. If
we desire good work from servants we
shall have to be more human and show
them that we take an interest in their
having a good time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Perhaps we have had such easy lives
ourselves that we have to go back to our
childhood to remember the delicious sense
of freedom from restraint when school
was out, in order to form some idea of
the pleasure a maid feels on her “afternoon”
when she leaves all duties behind
her and gets beyond the sound of the
bell. As a well-trained maid, she always
has to go about the house noiselessly,
never raising her voice in speaking unless
spoken to. Perhaps she doesn’t like
the other maids and longs for some congenial
friend and to talk and laugh unrestrainedly.
Is it surprising that she forgets
that she doesn’t have to pay her
board and lodging as the girls do who
are otherwise employed than in domestic
service, and that she only thinks of their
greater freedom? She naturally longs for
that freedom and for some time that she
can surely call her own.</p>

<p class='c011'>If any trouble crops up with this new
maid, don’t (because you are so sorry
that you let the other one go) offer her
higher wages or urge her to stay. It will
give you backbone to remember that she
will be useless if she stays while dissatisfied
and also that offering her higher
wages when you are paying enough is
only a bribe and simply makes her feel
more essential to you than she really is.
It wouldn’t remove the cause of her dissatisfaction
but only delay its coming to
the surface again. Sometimes by a quiet
talk you can find out what the trouble is
and if the complaint is reasonable you
can remove the cause.</p>

<p class='c011'>A case in point is an experience that
I myself once had when there was dissatisfaction
among some servants whom
I really liked. It was after I had, with a
great deal of trouble and study, tried to
arrange all their afternoons and evenings
out and their Sundays to be, as I thought,
convenient for myself and comfortable for
them. I was indignant at first at what
seemed ingratitude and felt ready to dismiss
them all. But, on sober thought, the
idea occurred to me of trying to get at
the bottom of the trouble by calling them
all together and letting each one in turn
tell me what was her cause of discontent.
At the same time I told them all that,
while I might not be able to do what they
wanted, still, as my only thought in arranging
their outings was to give them
rest and have them enjoy themselves, I
was ready to consider making some
changes so long as they would not interfere
with the proper and regular running
of the household. It seemed quite a new
idea to them that their mistress was really
interested in their pleasure. They were
nice women and with the prospect of a
sympathetic hearing, their antagonism
seemed to pass away.</p>

<p class='c011'>To my surprise I found that it was not
more outings that they wanted (in fact
they proposed fewer), but to be away
from the house longer at a time. I promised
them nothing at the moment because
I feared that I should say something unwise,
but impressed it upon them that they
would have to work together and help
one another if they wanted these changes.
This conversation resulted in my arranging
a programme that was satisfactory to
them and perfectly convenient to me, and
one that I have not had to change for
years.</p>

<p class='c011'>It may help you very much to find
out what I learned from this conversation,
so here it is. <i>The first point was that servants
need their regular outings to be longer
than they usually are</i>, because it takes them
so much longer than it does us to get
dressed and to reach the more remote
parts of the town where they usually go.
This seemed to me reasonable as I thought
over the work of the different servants.
Instead of just putting on her hat and coat
as we do, a maid has to change everything
to make herself neat and fresh to go to
church or shopping or to visit her friends.
If she has the ordinary two hours’ leave,
in most cases she would have to turn
around to come back almost as soon as
she reaches her destination. If she goes
to church we know the service will not
be out till after twelve-thirty or even later;
so that in order to return in time to set
the table by one o’clock, she must leave
the church instantly without a moment’s
chat with her friends. The waitress cannot
get her breakfast things finished before
ten o’clock in many households and
with the common habit of irregular Sunday
breakfasts generally it will be much
later. With the chambermaid the situation
is probably worse if there are a number
of rooms to make up, and it seems
almost impossible for the cook to get to
morning church unless some special arrangement
is made for her.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The second point was that servants would
like to be able to count on an absolutely certain,
specified time to leave the house and to
return</i>, both on Sundays and week-days.
This they cannot do if some of the family
stay in bed very late, if there is an invalid
in the house, or if there are extra
people at the Sunday lunch, unless the
mistress makes a very definite plan for
the servants to relieve one another, so that
their free time of going out or to church
will not be interfered with and the regular
work will still go on.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The third and last point that I can remember
is that most servants really do not
care to go out so frequently</i>, but that, on the
contrary, they would sometimes rather
stay at home on their day out if they
could be sure of the time to themselves
and that they would not be called on for
work.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>These three points are always carefully
conceded to them in hotels</i>, and consequently
hotel service is much desired by
maids, as housekeepers in small towns
find to their great inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c011'>This experience of mine may let light
into your situation and give you a basis
for a good programme. In working it out
it is necessary to be careful not to make
things comfortable for the servants at the
expense of the family. As the two points
of making the outing longer and starting
at regular hours can only be accomplished
by one servant taking the duty of the
other in her absence, it is important to
impress on their minds at the outset that
these duties must be performed so well
that the household will not be inconvenienced.
Since it is a fair exchange, maids
are usually contented to do this, and it is
the duty of the mistress to train them
and to see that each servant carries out
the idea, doing her fair share of the work.
Where there is more than one servant,
these outings can easily be arranged, even
with a family of irregular habits, so that
they all will be able to get off promptly
and stay out long enough, without any
inconvenience to the household. In the
case where there is only one maid, who
does the cooking and all the work of the
house, the household is, of necessity, run
more informally, and a chafing-dish meal
can take the place of one of the Sunday
meals in order to let her off. But if the
mistress feels that she must have her
meals go on just as regularly on Sunday
as any other day, she should hire some
one to come in for the time the servant
is out. You can readily see that she
should not expect one servant to keep
up the house unaided in just the way that
two or three servants do it.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have heard nice women say, “I have
only one servant, so of course I can’t let
her go out.” This is really cruel, though
not intentionally so, because, if the maid
has all the work to do, she needs a complete
and regular rest all the more. The
mistress should look upon the money
paid to some one for taking her place as
one of the regular necessary household
expenses.</p>

<p class='c011'>Whether there is one servant or many,
each one is entitled to some regular time
to herself and if housekeepers were more
careful about this there would be less
discontent among servants, I am sure.
As I said before, we need to be a great
deal more human in our relationship with
them. How reasonable, for example,
these three points seem when we take
the pains to see the servants’ point of
view, and how easy it would be to misjudge
the situation otherwise. What
most of them really want is to have some
time that they can actually call their own.
You would be surprised to know the
calm that settled down upon my family
and how much more home life there appeared
to be in the kitchen after I had
arranged a new programme of work and
given them these three points that they
wanted. Just try it and you will see for
yourself, and I am sure too, that you will
be glad to practice every virtue that good
house management requires if, in that
way, you can bring about peace instead
of that uncomfortable atmosphere which
constant dissatisfaction among the servants
causes. If a home is unhappy downstairs
you can always feel it upstairs, and,
in fact, sometimes at the front door.</p>

<p class='c011'>I believe I will enclose the plan for
the outings of three servants that has
worked so well in my case. A simpler
plan can be arranged for two servants because
they alternate. I have already said
what I think is our duty in case of one.</p>

<p class='c011'>What a long letter I have written
you! I send it on the “wings” of the
first mail hoping that it will reach you
in time really to help you in your present
situation.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c005'>CHAPTER IV <span class='c008'>⬩</span> MAID OF<br />ALL WORK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❧&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❧</h2>
</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>August 18</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope:</i></p>
<p class='c011'>Your ears must have burned this
morning, for I have been thinking so hard
of you. It is an entrancing day after a
storm, and the sound of the slow, dreamy
washing of the waves on the shore, as I
sit here knitting on the piazza, seem to
carry me far away from everything about
me to your dear self. The girls came
home yesterday from visiting Mrs. Gardner
with all the latest news of you, how
sweet and pretty your surroundings are,
and, best of all, Tom’s devotion to you
and your happiness. “Spooney,” they
called you both, but never mind, what
do they know about it? You and I understand,—that
is enough, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='c011'>Your little message to me showed that
there was one annoyance, however, weighing
on you in the midst of all this bliss,
the undercurrent of worry from signs of
discontent in the kitchen. When everything
is so bright and pleasant around
you, and you are <i>so</i> happy, why can’t
the maid feel so too? I am afraid it will
be many a long day before I can go
down to see you, but I am so glad I
have my hands and eyes and they shall
be devoted to you, dear child, this morning.
The more I think about the apparent
discontent of your present maid, the
more do I believe that it is because you
do not realize that a maid of all work
cannot do all that you expect her to do
and also give the finishing touches that
give charm to the home. I know how
you love everything to be the pink of
perfection, and it isn’t necessary for you
to lower your standards of refinement
of living,—only to remember to be content
to live more simply or informally
and that all the pretty little touches must
come from you. I have dined a number
of times with a young couple where
the wife, accustomed to servants before
her marriage, did most of the housework,
including the cooking, and only
had a woman come in for the rough
work, sweeping, etc., and to wash the
dishes when she had guests. The table
always looked refined and sweet and
the little apartment made you feel at
once the interested touch of the family.</p>

<p class='c011'>So don’t be discouraged because, after
your servant dusts, everything looks
crooked and the rooms have a neglected
appearance. It is simply because you
are asking too much of your maid, who
has all she can do in taking care of the
practical side of the housework. When
I spoke a little while ago of living more
simply, visions came before me of your
wedding day and the room, that looked
like a miniature Tiffany’s, spread out with
your wedding presents,—silver, cut glass,
and ornaments,—and then I thought of
your little maid and how impossible it
would be for her to keep the silver
looking bright as it should, with everything
else she has to do, and how discouraged
she would be at the very
thought of it. So my advice to you is to
put all your silver away that you do
not need until you have enough servants
to keep it bright without overworking
them. Your dining-room will look much
prettier with a few bright pieces than
overladen with silver that is dull and
gives the impression of careless housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c011'>You must remember that each of the
servants you have been accustomed to
had her own especial part of the housework
to do and plenty of time to do it
in. It isn’t so with the maid of all work.
She has so much to do that you really
have to choose what of the lighter work
you will find the pleasantest to perform
and do something yourself in order to
make her burden easier and have your
rooms look homelike and attractive. Suppose
you decide to make up your own
beds, do the dusting, and attend to the
lamps. That is all good exercise and
you can wear a pair of gloves to keep
your hands nice while you are working.
You can manage in this way. If the
maid gets up at six-thirty, dresses, throws
her mattress over the foot of her bed,
and opens her windows to air her room,
she can be ready to start the kitchen
fire, if there is a coal range, and put on
the cereal (which has been cooked the
night before and is much better for long
cooking) by seven o’clock. She can then
go into the parlor, draw up the shades
there and in the dining-room, rebuild
the fire if it has been used, and go over
the floor with a dustless mop. After that
she can set the dining-table and cook the
breakfast. (You will have to put your
beds to air yourself before you leave
your room.) When she has put the last
of your breakfast on the table, you can
wait on yourselves, leaving her to get
her own breakfast. (Just here I must
speak to you of the loneliness of the maid
of all work having all her meals by herself,
because, when you think of this,
and know that many of them never even
sit down to their table, I know you will
try to encourage yours to take proper
and regular meals and will see that the
kitchen is made a homelike place for her.)</p>

<p class='c011'>To return to the order of her work.
When you have finished your breakfast
she can clear the dining-table, wash
your breakfast things, and straighten the
kitchen. After that she should let you
know that she is ready to take your orders
for the meals. Having finished your breakfast
and seen Tom off for his business,
you might commence your share of the
housework by going to your room, making
up the beds, dusting it and all the
other rooms and putting them all in order.
When the maid lets you know that she is
ready to receive your orders for the day,
you should stop your work temporarily,
if you haven’t finished it, in order not
to delay hers, which is more important.
Then you should go with her to the refrigerator
and wire chest to see the left-overs
and plan the meals for the day,
utilizing the left-overs and writing on a
small pad, kept for the purpose, the bill
of fare for lunch, dinner, and breakfast,
pinning this up in the kitchen, to leave
no excuse for forgetting. All the orders
having been disposed of, the menus of the
day before can be gone over, praising the
successes and pointing out the mistakes.
This being finished, the maid can clean
the bathroom and do up her own room
and be ready for the work of the day
which can be arranged in some such way
as this:</p>
<table class='table2' summary=''>
<colgroup>
<col width='33%' />
<col width='66%' />
</colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'><i>Monday</i></td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class='c006'><i>Saturday</i></td>
    <td class='c018'>Kitchen, refrigerator, etc.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c014'>In the case of the maid of all work,
<i>washing the windows</i> has to be done by
outside labor, and the time to do it depends
a good deal on wind and weather.</p>

<p class='c011'>One has to be very considerate on
washing-day, planning ahead so as to
have a cold lunch if possible on that day
and not to invite any one to dinner. The
“afternoon out” is another time when the
maid must be thought of, and nothing
should be allowed to interfere with her
having this regular time to herself undisturbed.
You and Tom will have, both of
you, to understand the necessity of this
consideration so that he will realize that
he mustn’t bring friends home at these
times unless it is for such an informal frolic
that your guests understand it too, and
enjoy what you can have on the chafing-dish.
Don’t leave disorder for her to clear
up which would give her as much trouble
as getting the dinner. Lack of thought in
ways like this often causes a servant to
leave, though she won’t give you the true
reason.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sunday is another time when she has
to be thought of, to be sure to let her have
her time off so that she can get to church
or to see her friends. You will have to
arrange all this with reference to the
customs of the place in which you are
living or your distance from the center
of things. It is much better to accept the
fact that this must be arranged satisfactorily
to you both than to make some
arbitrary rule of your own which will
always cause trouble. If you compare
notes with your friends you will find
plenty who don’t do this, but you will
find plenty, too, who have ceaseless
trouble with servants.</p>

<p class='c011'>Every day except washing and ironing
day the maid can and should by three-thirty
o’clock be neatly dressed in black
with a white apron, to go to the door.
Plain black sateen waists are cheap and
wash perfectly well, so that she can wear
one while cooking, but I would advise you
to provide her also with turn-over collars
that are rather low at the neck, because
if she wears the stand-up kind she will
be pretty sure to take it off so as to be
comfortable when cooking and perhaps
mortify you by appearing at the door
sometime collarless.</p>

<p class='c011'>You will find that you can invite as
many as four to dinner informally, making
six in all, with a maid of all work if
you have some one in to help her wash
the dishes. I don’t mean for you to engage
an expert for this, for they are expensive,
but some friend of your maid
who enjoys the sociability of coming with
the prospect of a good dinner and a little
extra money thrown in. Of course you
have to arrange to have things that don’t
take much time or can be prepared the
day before and that your maid cooks especially
well, never trying a new dish
at such a time.</p>

<p class='c011'>It can be a nice little dinner, nevertheless.
Suppose you begin with <i>grapefruit</i>,
which you can arrange yourself, cutting
out the center and putting sugar in and
setting it in the ice-box early in the day
so that the juices will be drawn out and
it will be cold and delicious by dinner
time. Next, <i>a clear soup</i>, which can be prepared
the day before or can be a canned
consommé of the best make, flavored with
a little lemon, and with a thin slice of
lemon in each plate. (Even if your maid
can make a delicious cream soup I wouldn’t
advise attempting it, since it takes too
much time on the day of the dinner.)
Third, <i>a roast and two or three vegetables</i>.
For the fourth course <i>a salad</i> which you
can prepare yourself, making the dressing.
Next the fifth course, <i>ice-cream and
cake</i>, or some other bought dessert; and,
finally, <i>coffee</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>All these suggestions that I have
written you have actually been tried
and found practical and cause the least
amount of friction, so I send them to
you to modify to suit your own case.
That is where your genius will come in—the
modifications that oil the machinery
of your house to suit your circumstances
and your maid’s particular characteristics.</p>

<p class='c011'>I have only a minute before the mail
goes to add another suggestion to this
long letter of advice, and that is that it
might help you to look into the question
of the innumerable domestic labor-saving
machines, such as fireless cookers, bread-mixers,
vacuum cleaners, washing-machines,
electric utensils of all sorts and
kinds, and see if there are any that could
be used to advantage in your household.
With every wish that contentment may
soon reign in your kitchen,</p>
<p class='c012'>Devotedly yours,</p>

</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>August 27</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>Your sense of the ludicrous is going
to be of the greatest help over rough
places, for often little troubles seem to
vanish if we can only laugh over them.
I was very much amused with your clever
devices to cover up from your maid the
fact that you could not remember in what
order her work ought to be done. It is
surprising, isn’t it, how we can go on
living for years in our mothers’ well-ordered
households without ever thinking
what the method is that makes everything
go so like clockwork?</p>

<p class='c011'>But it is the experience of most of
us, and this letter shall go off at once to
you hoping to reach you before the next
sweeping day, for, as I understand it, that
is the vital question for the moment.
Without any preamble I shall plunge
right into my subject. With two or three
maids, of course, every room should have
its regular weekly cleaning, but where
there is but one she can only manage to
sweep each room once in two weeks, you
arranging the order of her work as I suggested
to you in my last letter.</p>

<p class='c011'>I will give you two methods of cleaning,
one with a broom, and the other with
a vacuum cleaner, but I strongly recommend
the cleaner as it raises almost no
dust and makes the cleaning much easier.
You can buy a kind now in the department
stores that is no heavier than an ordinary
carpet sweeper, is used the same
way by hand, does not require electricity
in the house, and is comparatively inexpensive,
ranging from six dollars up.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The following is the order for the thorough
weekly cleaning with a broom:</i></p>

<p class='c011'>Before beginning run the shades up to
the top and open the windows at the top
keeping them shut at the bottom. The
rising hot air will then carry the dust out
of the window, while, if the window be
open at the bottom, the cold air, which
falls, will blow the dust in.</p>

<p class='c011'>Take small rugs out to be shaken.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brush window sills and lower part of
blinds.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dust each small piece of furniture and
take it out of the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shake out of the window all table
covers and take them out of the room
while the cleaning is going on.</p>

<p class='c011'>If it is a bedroom, cover bed with dusting
sheet.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brush hard all upholstered furniture
with a whisk broom and cover with dusting
sheets.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dust all ornaments laying them carefully
under dusting sheet on sofa or
bed.</p>

<p class='c011'>All little things being out of the room
and large pieces of furniture covered,
sweep carpet or rug, and then, with dustless
mop, go over the floor, being careful
to clean under heavy pieces of furniture
that cannot be moved, rubbing the floor
well, but not using oil, as it soils light
dresses, or water, as it takes the polish
off. Once a month or oftener wax the
floor and polish it with a soft cloth on
your broom or a polishing brush that
comes for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Clean mirrors</i> by washing with water
that has a little ammonia in it. Wipe and
polish with a lintless cloth or newspaper.
Newspaper is always on hand and makes
a fine polish.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Wash the gas globes</i> if they are dirty
(probably about once a month), being
careful not to screw them on tight when
they are put back, as that makes the
globes crack when they get hot.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Take away</i> all soiled bureau and sideboard
covers. Lay the fire if it has been
used, and wash up the hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Laying a coal fire in the grate</i>: Put the
blower on to prevent as much as possible
the ashes flying about. Shake the ashes
down through the bars of the grate with
a poker. Remove them from the pan
with the shovel and put them in the coal
scuttle. Take the ash-pan out and brush
under it. Take the blower off and twist
newspapers in loose rolls and put them
in the bottom of the grate. Lay kindlings
crosswise on top of the paper with
spaces for draughts in between. Put
coal on top of the kindlings. When
the fire is wanted, put the blower on,
and light the fire from below. When
the coal is well caught, take the blower
off.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Laying an open wood fire</i>: Place a
large log close against the back of the
chimney, another in front, leaving a space
between. In this space between the two
lay lightly pieces of newspaper twisted
loosely; on top of this paper place kindlings
crosswise resting on both logs, and
far enough apart to let the air through;
then one or two other sticks on top of
the kindlings bark side down. Do not
remove the ashes from a wood fire, as it
burns better on a bed of hot ashes.</p>

<p class='c011'>If soot should ever fall from the chimney
on to the rug, sprinkle the place
thickly with corn meal and brush it up.
This removes at once what otherwise
would be a bad stain.</p>

<p class='c011'>After the fire has been laid, <i>empty all</i>
scraps from scrap baskets into a receptacle
and take this and also the hod of
ashes, if the fire was of coal, downstairs.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Close</i> windows, pull shades down half-way,
arrange curtains, take covers off
furniture, bring chairs back. Put clean
bureau and sideboard covers on, and
put the ornaments back in their places.
Fold up dusting sheets and put them
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>If brasses are brightened once a week,
they remain bright with less effort, but
if you have a good many it is best to reserve
one morning for this, as it is dirty
work. A pair of large old gloves should
be provided to keep the hands clean when
doing it. Just as with silver, with only
one maid it is better not to have too
many brasses out, unless you can hire
some one to clean them.</p>

<p class='c011'>When I tell you the order of cleaning
a room by a hand-power vacuum cleaner
that is made only to sweep the carpets
and rugs, does not go by electricity, and
has no attachments, you will see that it
saves you the most troublesome and
heaviest part of the work of sweeping
day and that two or three rooms can be
cleaned in the time it would take to
clean one with a broom. By the following
order of work you get the best results
and do not have to go a second
time over any of your dusting. No dusting
sheets have to be used, rugs do not
have to be taken up nor furniture and
ornaments removed. Of course, before
beginning to clean you open windows
and arrange shades in the same way that
I described when preparing to sweep a
room with a broom.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>The weekly cleaning of a room with a
hand-power vacuum cleaner</i>:</p>

<p class='c011'>Brush window sills.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brush hard all upholstered furniture
with a whisk broom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shake out of the window all table covers
and take them out of the room while
cleaning is going on.</p>

<p class='c011'>Go over carpet or rugs with the vacuum
cleaner and then the bare floor
with a dustless mop. (Sweeping with a
vacuum cleaner is supposed not to make
any dust, but as it isn’t perfection there
is a fine dust that rises from it; so all
the dusting should come after the sweeping.)</p>

<p class='c011'>Dust every piece of furniture, shaking
duster out of window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dust all ornaments and shelves.</p>

<p class='c011'>Clean mirrors and do all the work
coming after this in the same order as
described in cleaning a room with a broom.</p>

<p class='c011'>With the more expensive electric
power vacuum cleaners the order of work
is the same, but there are all sorts of attachments
to clean floors, upholstered
furniture, curtains, etc., that any of their
agents would explain to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>I am speaking from experience when
advising a vacuum cleaner, because, after
using an electric one in town, I bought
for use here, where I haven’t electricity
in the house, the hand-power kind, as I
couldn’t stand the dust made by an ordinary
broom. If you decide to get one, do
let me know how you like it.</p>

</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>August 28</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>After I sent off my letter to
you, I turned over your last page and
found a scrawl that I didn’t notice at
first,—a polite little request for the details
of serving one’s every day meals.
Why, of course, I will give it to you,
and shall take it for granted that your
maid’s mind is a perfect blank on the subject.
So much the better, for now you
can put into it just what you want her to
have there.</p>

<p class='c011'>I would begin by impressing on her
how important it is to have the tablecloth
smooth with the creases running
straight down the middle and everything
set evenly on the table. Show her yourself
how neat it looks when done in this
way and how badly when the things are
crooked. If she hasn’t a straight eye, the
only way to do is to give her a foot-rule
and have her measure distances at first
until her eye is trained. Don’t attempt
anything elaborate and be content to use
your simple china which can be easily
replaced, so that when, in her awkwardness,
she breaks it, your heart won’t be
broken too. Perhaps you can find some
old china-cabinet with glass doors in
which you can keep those beautiful plates
that were among your wedding presents,
and be able to have them to look
at without their being any care. If the
maid hasn’t too much to attend to, she
will be able to do what she does do,
well, and if you have your meals served
nicely every day, then, when you have
guests, she will not be confused by some
new order of things, but will be perfectly
natural and serve them well as a matter
of course. Your own meals, too, will go
more quickly and easily and be more appetizing
if always served carefully and
regularly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Let us take a perfectly simple family
dinner: First course, soup; second course,
roast and (two) or (three) vegetables;
third course, salad or dessert; fourth
course, coffee; and begin to train her in
this way:</p>

<p class='c019'>See that the canton flannel undercloth is
perfectly smooth on the table.</p>

<p class='c020'>Over this place the tablecloth with the
crease going exactly down the middle.</p>

<p class='c020'>Make sure that whatever glass, silver,
china, knives, etc., is to be used on the table
is bright.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put a dinner plate for each person at even
distances apart from one another.</p>

<p class='c020'>To the right of each plate place as many
knives as you need with their sharp edges
turned toward the plate, then next to them
the soup spoon with the hollow part of the
bowl of the spoon turned up.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put the napkin at the right of the soup
spoon, folded over neatly once, as it would take
up too much room square, and lay on it exactly
in the middle a piece of bread cut about
three inches long by one and a half thick and
two inches wide, or else a roll.</p>

<p class='c020'>Place a tumbler at the point of the knives.</p>

<p class='c020'>At the left of each plate lay as many forks
as are needed for the meal, with their prongs
turned upward and placed in the order in
which they are to be used, the fork for the
first course being on the outside and farthest
from the plate.</p>

<p class='c020'>Exactly in the center of the table put your
plant.</p>

<p class='c020'>Place a salt cellar and a pepper pot in each
corner of an imaginary square of which the
plant is the center.</p>

<p class='c020'>Arrange the side-table—or sideboard, if
you have no side-table—with everything extra
on it that will be needed during the meal,
so that you will never have to open a drawer
while you are serving it.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put on this table, in nice order, so that it
will look attractive, the dessert plates, on each
of which is a finger bowl with a doily under
it; also any cold plates such as salad plates, if
they are to be used, and any extra forks,
spoons, sauce ladles, etc., that will be required.</p>

<p class='c020'>Fill the finger bowls a third full of water
and place a fork and a spoon on the doily, one
on one side, the other on the other, of the finger
bowl.</p>

<p class='c020'>Have also on the side-table a plate of bread,
the pieces all cut the same size as those already
on the dining-table.</p>

<p class='c020'>Set a pitcher of iced water in a convenient
place in pantry or dining-room.</p>

<p class='c020'>Arrange a tray with the after-dinner coffee-cups
on it and the bowl of lump sugar and
sugar tongs in the center. Put an after-dinner
coffee spoon on each saucer. Have this in
pantry.</p>

<p class='c020'>(The only spoon that is ever put with the
forks and knives by the plates on the table is
the soup spoon. Teaspoons for grapefruit,
for bouillon, tea, coffee, etc., are always put
on the plate or saucer on which these foods
and drinks are served.)</p>

<p class='c020'>When the dining- and side-tables are set
and the first course ready to come into the
dining-room, fill the tumblers with iced water.</p>

<p class='c020'>Go into the pantry and pour each soup
plate half full of soup.</p>

<p class='c020'>If it is the custom of the family to use a
musical Japanese gong to announce meals,
strike it two or three light taps. If they don’t
use one, then go to the mistress wherever
she is and say quietly, “Dinner is served,
Mrs. ——.”</p>

<p class='c020'>When every one is seated, take a plate of
soup in each hand and place each plate in
turn in front of each person, laying it on the
dinner plate that is already there, serving the
older members of the family first, if there are
children, otherwise going right around the
table, always laying it down from the right
side of each person.</p>

<p class='c020'>When the soup course is finished and the
second course is in the pantry, bring a hot
plate in your left hand and, taking up the serving
plate, with the soup plate on it, in your
right, replace it with the fresh hot one, doing
this from the right side of each person; going,
in this way, all around the table till all have
hot, clean plates.</p>

<p class='c020'>Then bring in the platter of meat, placing
it in front of the carver with the carving knife,
which has been sharpened before the meal, at
his right and the fork at his left side. Put the
gravy boat and ladle at his right.</p>

<p class='c020'>Stand at the left of the carver with an extra
hot plate in your hand and, taking the
plate with meat on it, put the empty, hot
plate in its place. This gives the carver time
to cut another slice and have it ready when
you come back with the next empty plate.</p>

<p class='c020'>Now go right around the table putting a
plate of meat before each person and taking
up the empty plate till all have been served.
Put down and take up from the right
side.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there is jelly or any small thing to pass,
put it on a small tray, having first placed a
spoon in it, and, taking the tray in one hand
and a vegetable dish in the other, pass them
all around the table, stooping a little as you
first offer one, and then draw back and offer
the other on the <i>left</i> side of each person.</p>

<p class='c020'>(It is a good rule to remember in serving
a meal that everything that admits of a choice
must be <i>passed</i> at the <i>left</i> and that everything
that does not admit of a choice must be <i>placed</i>
from the <i>right</i>.)</p>

<p class='c020'>Next take the remaining vegetable in one
hand and a plate of bread in the other and
pass them to the left of each person all around
the table.</p>

<p class='c020'>Watch carefully to pass food again before
any one has a chance to ask for anything and
see that all have water and bread throughout
the dinner.</p>

<p class='c020'>When every one has finished this course,
remove first the meat platter, being careful
that the carvers and spoon are secure so as
not to drop off. Then remove gravy boat on
a small tray. Take out vegetables, bread, etc.
Remove the used plates, one in each hand,
never piling them on top of each other.</p>

<p class='c020'>Bring a tray and quietly remove peppers
and salts and any knives and forks remaining
on the table and take them into the pantry.</p>

<p class='c020'>Bring a plate or small tray and with a
napkin remove the crumbs.</p>

<p class='c020'>From the side-table bring a dessert plate in
each hand until you have given one to each
person, always going to the <i>right</i> of the person
to set it down.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put the dessert in front of the mistress,
the spoon to left, and sauce boat with spoon
on her right side.</p>

<p class='c020'>Stand by her with an empty dessert plate
and pass the plates as in the other courses.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the dessert is finished remove dessert
and all the plates, and, after having filled the
cups with hot coffee in the pantry, pass them
around to the family, either at the table or in
the parlor, whichever your mistress desires.
If the coffee is taken in the parlor, bring an
empty tray in later and take away the coffee-cups.</p>

<p class='c020'>Always remember that everything belonging
to one course must be removed before
serving another course.</p>

<p class='c020'>If the last course is salad instead of dessert,
then, as you take off the used plates of
the meat course, replace them with cold plates,
bring the bowl of salad on and do not remove
crumbs, salts, etc., until this course is finished.
If your mistress prefers to make the
salad dressing herself, put the bowl of lettuce
in front of her, and at her right hand the oil,
vinegar, and condiments she desires, and a
small bowl and a tablespoon to mix the dressing
in. When she has made the dressing and
mixed it with the lettuce, quickly remove, on
a tray, the oil, vinegar, etc., and pass the
salad bowl around to each person, offering
with your other hand a plate of crackers.
This course being finished, remove salad, then
plates, then peppers, salts, small silver, and
then crumbs as described before. After that
bring on finger-bowl plates. Then coffee as
before.</p>

<p class='c020'>If your mistress prefers not to serve a meat
course, such as chops that need no carving,
or a dessert course, such as berries that are
easily served, you can pass them around
without setting them on the table.</p>

<p class='c014'>Having now explained the method of
serving the family dinner the following
few suggestions will be sufficient for
breakfast and lunch:</p>

<p class='c019'>If your mistress does not use a tablecloth
for breakfast, place the centerpiece exactly in
the middle of the table and in the center of
this the plate of fruit (or the plant if there is
no fruit). Have the under-plate doily at each
place and on it put a fruit plate on which is
a finger bowl one third full of water, with a
fruit knife at the right of the bowl and a spoon
at the left on the plate. To the left of this
put a small plate for bread and butter or
muffins. Knives and forks are placed the
same as for dinner, just as many as you need
for the meal.</p>

<p class='c020'>In front of your mistress place the breakfast
tray for coffee-urn, hot-water kettle, hot-milk
pitcher, and sugar-bowl, but do not
bring the hot things in till the family is ready
to have breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>Arrange the side-table with any extra things
that will be needed.</p>

<p class='c020'>Keep the butter cool and bring it on at the
last moment and place it on one side of the
table opposite the bread, which has been
freshly cut.</p>

<p class='c020'>Leave the rest of the loaf of bread in the
pantry on a bread-board with the bread-knife
ready to cut more slices if needed.</p>

<p class='c020'>See that the newspaper is ready for the
master of the house where he likes to have
it.</p>

<p class='c020'>Look around to see if the sideboard drawers
are all tightly closed so as to look neat
and trim.</p>

<p class='c020'>Touch the gong lightly to announce breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>Bring on hot coffee, hot milk, and the hot-water
kettle.</p>

<p class='c020'>When all are seated, pass around the fruit,
then stand at your mistress’s left with a small
tray and taking the coffee-cups as she fills
them, place them in turn at the right of each
person.</p>

<p class='c020'>When the fruit course is finished, remove
the plates, putting fresh hot ones in their
places in the same way that you do it at
dinner.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put the main dish of the breakfast in front
of your master and the others square and
opposite one another on the table.</p>

<p class='c020'>See that every one has water in his tumbler
and then go to get your own breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>Family lunch is served much as dinner is
served unless your mistress prefers to have it
as informal as the breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>At either lunch or breakfast, when you
pass hot muffins, bread, hot cakes, or pancakes,
always pass the butter on the same
tray so that no one will have the disagreeable
experience of a muffin almost cold before the
butter reaches him.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am afraid, Penelope, that you may
think these directions that I give you for
your maid are very detailed, but my experience
with the untrained servant has
taught me that you can never tell what
unpleasant surprises she may give you
in her way of serving your meals, if you
haven’t forestalled her by telling her
every minutest detail. You can see that
I think that with a maid of all work the
breakfast and lunch should be very informal
meals, and that with breakfast
you should wait on yourselves after she
has placed the main course on the table.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is a very nice English contrivance
for the breakfast and lunch table
that I should think you would find convenient
in the case of your maid of all
work when you want to dispense with
her services as much as possible. It is
a small, low, revolving table to set in the
middle of one’s dining-table on which
are placed muffins, butter, etc., and
which by the slightest touch is made
to move around so that anything on it
comes in reach of all at the table. I have
seen only handsome ones in mahogany,
but I am sure they must come in other
kinds of wood if that is not what your
table is made of.</p>

<p class='c011'>Another piece of furniture that I should
think you would find useful is a “dinner
wagon”—a tray on wheels that can be
rolled from one room to another. After
the family have left the table the maid
can clear it much more quickly by using
this tray to remove the things to the
pantry.</p>

<p class='c011'>I haven’t said a word about your centerpiece,
but I have a suggestion for that
too! Ferns are very pretty for the center
of the dinner table, but you will find
it quite expensive to keep them always
fresh, whereas if you plant some grapefruit
seeds in a pot, you will have a
charming little growing plant like a
miniature orange tree with pretty glossy
leaves which will last and give a very
attractive air to your table.</p>

<p class='c011'>I also think you will find candles for
the dining-table cost too much for every
day, but can be an additional touch when
you have guests. I wouldn’t advise you
to try to follow every fashion on a
small income. It will take away spontaneousness
and give a strained feeling
about what you do. No matter how rich
you may become in the future, there will
always be some one who has still more,
and is able to live more luxuriously, so
cultivate independence of spirit if you
want contentment. People who are always
straining to have what they cannot
afford, in order to keep up with those
about them, can never be satisfied, and
have nothing in the end but disappointed
hopes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now, Penelope, dear, I haven’t stopped
to take breath since I started this letter,
and I am tired, so no more until the next
snag you may encounter. With the firm
conviction that all your friends will try
to vie with you in your good housekeeping,</p>
<p class='c012'>Very affectionately yours,</p>

</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>September 30</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>My dear Penelope</i>:</p>
<p class='c011'>Since my last letter to you Eloise
has begged me to write out the duties of
three servants,—chambermaid, waitress
and cook,—for a very inexperienced
friend of hers, Hope Conroy, who is well
off and expects to begin housekeeping
soon; so you see what trouble my letters
to you have brought on me! It occurred
to me that you might like to have these
notes for future reference when Tom
has reached that pinnacle of success which
we all predict for him, so I am enclosing
a copy of them in this letter. You don’t
need them now, but why not tie all my
letters on this subject together and make
a book to keep, for easy reference, in
a convenient place,—that top bureau
drawer, for instance?</p>

<p class='c011'>You remember meeting Hope Conroy,
I am sure, when you were visiting
us last year, and have probably heard
that she is to be married next month. It
has made Eloise, who is practical, and
who simply adores her, quite unhappy
that Hope seems to think it so amusing
that she knows nothing about housekeeping.
With all Eloise’s brothers she
has had a chance to understand men pretty
well, and she thinks, with me, that there
would be fewer divorces if young girls
only knew how much a man cares for his
comfort. So, in view of this, I felt I must
yield to Eloise’s request despite the
amount of writing it entailed at a time
when I was quite busy with other things.
I think I have just barely alluded, in some
of my letters to you, to my method of
recording the servants’ duties, but I know
I haven’t explained it at all so I will now
give you just what I wrote to Hope without
any further comment:</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Extract from my letter to Hope on the duties of three servants</i></h3>
<p class='c019'>It was after I had been married for several
years and had become weary of recalling
afresh for each new servant the details of her
work in order to train her into my ways of
doing it, that I decided to write a small
blank book for each one of them, containing
her daily duties, her weekly duties, the arrangement
for her Sundays and her afternoons
out—something that I could keep permanently
and thus save myself much trouble.
If you dislike detail as much as I do these
books will help you too. When the servants
first came I read them to each one letting each
keep her own while she was with me and
taking the precaution to have a copy of them
all in my housekeeping book in case any misunderstanding
should arise.</p>

<p class='c020'>Realizing that much of the <i>general duties</i> must
be different in every household, according to
the number of the family and the number and
arrangement of rooms, and whether they live
in an apartment house or not, I shall only attempt
to give you an idea of how these books
were written, just enough to help you make
out your own books to suit the requirements of
your family. This is the reason I describe the
<i>general duties</i> only in a <i>general</i> way, and the
<i>daily duties</i> (where the manner of doing
the work is practically always the same) I describe
in <i>detail</i>, addressing the maids directly
as I did in the books which I made for my
own servants. Although the instructions to
the maids are in some cases identical, yet, in
order to make them clear, I repeat them in
each case, even though it seems unnecessary.
It would be my advice to you in making your
book to arrange the daily duties of the servants
so as to insure the early starting of the
household. For instance, let the chambermaid
wake you on her way downstairs at a
specified hour, and, at the same time, let the
waitress come to get the silver. If you have
a safe for your silver, you could leave out
just enough for your breakfast and have it
brought to your room at night so that she
would stop and get it in the morning.</p>

<p class='c020'>It is also a good plan to let the servants have
their breakfast before the family except in the
case of a maid of all work, when this is almost
impossible to arrange.</p>

<p class='c020'>Then, about their Sundays, I think that
church can’t do us much good if we don’t
give the servants an opportunity to go, too,
if they want to, or if we make it a hard
day for them. Though it requires special arrangement,
their Sundays should be made a
day to look forward to with pleasure when
each one can be sure of getting out, at some
part of the day, to church, or to see her
friends. The Sunday morning that the cook
goes out, the lunch should be one that can
be quickly cooked or her outing would be too
short. In the case of the waitress and chambermaid,
if, on their Sunday morning out,
they waited to finish their work, they would
get out so late, in most places, that it wouldn’t
be worth while to go at all. This explains
why, in the plan that I shall give you, it is
arranged that, on their Sunday mornings out,
the chambermaid and waitress stop whatever
work they are doing promptly at 10 <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, and
get ready to go out, the one who is <i>in</i> taking
the work up where the other one has left it
and finishing it in addition to her own. You
will also see that, with the following plan, you
can take your choice of having late dinner
every other Sunday (when the cook is at
home) or every Sunday if your waitress is sufficiently
expert and your cook prepares some
of the dinner dishes before going out. Sometimes
it is the chambermaid and sometimes
the waitress that can cook best and likes the
afternoon all to herself. It doesn’t matter
which you choose for that duty; you simply
use tact in this as in all your housekeeping.</p>

<p class='c020'>As for giving them any freedom in the
evenings I think you will find it a good plan
to let the chambermaid and waitress alternate
in going out, provided their services are not
required; this insures one always being in
the house so that the cook never has to go
to the door. It is rather an understood thing
that the cook can go out any evening after her
regular work is done, of course, if her services
are not required.</p>

<p class='c020'>With regard to the cook’s weekly duties
I have never found that they could be laid
down as definitely as those of the other servants
on account of dinners and lunches coming
in, when all her time has to be devoted
to the cooking. Therefore the washing and
ironing (if it is done in the house), the weekly
cleaning of the kitchen, the hall steps, etc.,
semiweekly cleaning of refrigerator and keeping
the shelves and closets clean, all have to
be fitted in when she can manage them. On
this very account the mistress, in her morning
visits to the kitchen, should look around
carefully to be sure that nothing is neglected,
for everything about a kitchen should be very
clean if you want it to be sanitary.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Description of the chambermaid’s book—Her general work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Under this head was told, in paragraphs,
thus dividing the subjects so that they could
be more easily seen and understood, what
rooms, halls, stairs, etc., she had charge of,
whether she made up the rooms of the other
servants, washed her own clothes, bed-linen,
etc., or had any of the duties of a lady’s maid,
such as mending, brushing, and taking out
or putting away her master’s and mistress’s
clothes, or washing their brushes and combs
(which she can do if the family is small), or
polishing her mistress’s boots. As to her neatness,—what
she was expected to wear, and
what her mistress provided her with, and about
asking her mistress for anything needed in
order to do her work well. The same instructions
were given her about waiting on the door
that were given the waitress, telling her that
when workmen, inspectors, and such people
had any work to do in her part of the house,
she should accompany them around wherever
they went.</p>

<p class='c020'>Doing her work quietly and noiselessly was
emphasized, especially the opening and shutting
of blinds, windows, and doors, and just
how a window should be opened top and bottom
when airing a room, so that the hot air
could go out above and the fresh cold air come
in below, thus insuring good ventilation. It
was impressed upon her that the doors of a
room should be shut while the windows were
open so as not to chill the rest of the house.</p>

<p class='c020'>Her duty with regard to trays was described,—that
when any member of the family was
unable to come down to a meal she would be
expected to take the tray up so that the meal
of the family would not be disturbed by the
waitress leaving the table to do this; also that
she would prepare and bring up breakfast trays
where needed and that she should always hand
anything on a tray, even if it were only a paper
of pins. Her duty on the arrival of guests
was explained: that she should be ready to
carry their bags upstairs, but that she should
not unpack their bags without asking if it was
desired. It was made clearly understood that,
when her mistress had guests to dinner, she
was to assist in the pantry, and when there
were many, she was to help in the dining-room
and also to help departing guests on
with their wraps when they left the house.
That she was to do the duties of the waitress
when the waitress was out was explained to
her, so that she would perform them without
awkwardness.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Her daily work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Be up early, throw mattress and bedclothes
over the foot of your bed to air.</p>

<p class='c020'>After dressing, open windows top and bottom
in your room, put pillows near window
to air, closing the door of your room and
always of any room you are airing (if the
family is up) so as not to chill the rest of the
house.</p>

<p class='c020'>On your way downstairs open the windows
in your halls top and bottom to air. If desired,
wake your mistress at the time specified. Have
your own breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>If none of the family rooms are vacated
when you have finished your breakfast, brush
down the stairs and do up your own room;
otherwise put all the family rooms to air, ending
with guest room so that you can go right
on with that room and finish it first.</p>

<p class='c020'>When beginning a room draw back the
curtains, pull the shades up to the top, open
the windows top and bottom. Open closet
doors and keep them open while room airs so
that they won’t get stuffy.</p>

<p class='c020'>Shake pillows and put them near the window,
but so they won’t show from the
street.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put two chairs at foot of bed, draw blankets
and sheets over them, turn the mattress over
the foot of the bed so that the air can go over
and under it.</p>

<p class='c020'>Put soiled clothing in bag or basket provided
for it.</p>

<p class='c020'>Hang or fold and put away clothing or
dresses.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there has been a coal fire remove ashes,
make fire up ready to light, wipe hearth; if
a wood fire, leave the ashes.</p>

<p class='c020'>Empty slops, if there is a wash-basin in the
room, clean bathroom, washing tub and basin
with hot water and soap or a cleanser, such as
Dutch Cleanser, and dry them with a soft cloth.</p>

<p class='c020'>Wash out soap-dish and other crockery
and always see that there is soap in the dish.
Wash bowl of w.c. with a stiff brush that
comes for the purpose.</p>

<p class='c020'>Dust chair and woodwork and see that
there are no spots on the mirror. Remove
soiled towels putting clean ones in their place.
Take great care not to let anything go down
the pipes that would clog them.</p>

<p class='c020'>The bed having now had a chance to air,
turn mattress over and make up bed.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there are any scraps on the carpet,
brush them up with dust pan and brush or
carpet sweeper.</p>

<p class='c020'>Dust furniture.</p>

<p class='c020'>Empty scrap basket and put contents in
bag to carry downstairs.</p>

<p class='c020'>Shut windows, draw shades down half-way,
and arrange curtains to hang smooth;
then go to next room.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the bedrooms are finished, begin the
special weekly morning work for that day,
sweeping rooms or cleaning bedrooms, silver,
or brasses, or whatever it may be.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the morning work is over, make
yourself neat and be ready to assist at lunch
table, if there are guests, or to go to the
front door while waitress is serving lunch or
dressing for the afternoon or is out or serving
dinner.</p>

<p class='c020'>In arranging the rooms for the night, first
close the blinds, if desired, then draw down
the shades, put soiled clothes in hamper,
hanging up clothing in closets, putting back
in its place anything that has been disarranged
and leaving the room in order.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there is a washstand in the room, remove
waste water and fill pitchers.</p>

<p class='c020'>If night pillows are used, remove day pillows
and shams; if same pillows as day, take
off shams, fold them carefully in their creases,
and lay them where they will not get tumbled.</p>

<p class='c020'>Remove bedspread, fold smooth. Open bed-clothing,
turning down the corner on one side,
for one person or on both sides for two.</p>

<p class='c020'>Lay night-clothes neatly folded on the
turned-down corner, placing wrapper at the
foot with slippers by it.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there is company be ready to assist the
waitress.</p>

<p class='c020'>The weekly duties in detail, such as the
thorough cleaning of each room, bathroom,
halls, bedrooms, silver and brasses, also the
Sunday arrangements and afternoons and
evenings out, should appear here at the end
of the chambermaid’s book, but I cannot put
it in for you, as it varies in different households
and localities.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Description of the waitress’s book—Her general work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Under this head she was told what rooms,
halls, stairs, etc., she had charge of (so
that there could be no discussion between
the maids); also, if the vestibule was under
her charge, she was reminded that, as the
entrance is the first impression people get
of a house, nothing will make them think
the waitress incompetent so quickly as an
untidy vestibule and front hall, and that every
morning the doormat should be shaken, the
floor brushed clean, and the woodwork dusted;
also the brasses rubbed up if they have become
dull in between the weekly cleanings.
It was made clear to her whether she made
up her own room, washed her own clothes
and bed-linen or aprons, or had any part in
the family washing and ironing. Neatness in
her work and person was spoken of—wearing
checked gingham apron over her white one
when doing such work as cleaning brasses and
silver, so that if she had to go to the front door
or answer any bell, she could slip it off easily
and appear properly dressed with clean white
apron; how necessary it was to have clean
hands when waiting on the table and handling
food; also about what she was expected
to wear and what her mistress provided for
her, and about asking her mistress for anything
that she needed to do her work well.</p>

<p class='c020'>Doing her work noiselessly was emphasized,
especially opening and shutting blinds, windows,
and doors, and how the windows should
be opened top and bottom when airing to insure
good ventilation, and that the door of the
room should be kept closed during this airing
in order not to chill the rest of the house.
She was reminded that the dining-room
needed more airing than any other room and
should be aired a few moments after every
meal, and also that the crumbs under the
table should be brushed up after each meal.</p>

<p class='c020'>The use of a tray was explained to her:
that only <i>small</i> articles should be handed and
removed on a tray when <i>waiting on the table</i>,
and that at other times she should always
hand things on a tray, if it were only a paper
of pins. That promptness was necessary in
answering bells, especially the front doorbell,
cautioning her as to whom she should let in
and who should wait outside the door, and
that when any workmen, inspectors, and
such people had any work to do in the house
she should accompany them around wherever
they go in her part of the house, and if they
should go to other parts of the house call the
chambermaid or cook to accompany them;
also that she should not allow anything to be
taken out of the house unless she had been
told to do so by some member of the family.</p>

<p class='c020'>It was impressed on her that she must find
out, <i>before going to the door</i>, whether her mistress
was in or out, so as never to keep any
one waiting, and that she should open the
door wide to let visitors in and then stand
back to allow them to precede her, carrying a
tray to the door for the cards, and, if they
have no cards, offering a pencil and pad, which
should always be kept in the front hall, for
name or message.</p>

<p class='c020'>It was also impressed upon her that when
waiting on the table she should not speak unless
spoken to, except when having a message
to deliver; and in case of an accident, such
as dropping a knife, fork, or plate, she should
pick it up and take it into the pantry, immediately
replacing it with a fresh one. She was
directed, should anything be dropped on the
carpet to wipe it up at once, or if water or
wine should be spilled on tablecloth, to dry it
without a word, covering the spot with a
fresh napkin. She was told that in case of a
wine or fruit stain on tablecloth or napkins
she should draw the spot tightly over a bowl,
as soon after the meal as possible, while the
stain was fresh, and pour <i>boiling</i> water through
it and thus remove the stain at once, and that
the water must be really <i>boiling</i>, as hot water
would only set the stain. She was also told
how particular she should be when setting the
table not to get finger marks on china, silver,
or glass, and that if she should see holes in
tablecloth or napkins she should call her mistress’s
attention to it before letting them go
to the wash; that when the table was set she
should see that no drawers or doors of sideboard
or china closet were left open, to look
disorderly, and also that it was her duty to
see that the carving-knife was sharp and that
plates used for a hot course should be warm,
and for a cold course, cold.</p>

<p class='c020'>Leaving her pantry in nice order after
every meal was mentioned, and that she
should not let soiled towels collect there, but
every day wash out the towels, dish cloths,
and mop and hang them up to dry, once a
week thoroughly washing, scalding, and ironing
them, always keeping fresh ones on hand
to take the place of soiled ones.</p>

<p class='c020'>The importance of letting the chambermaid
know when she went upstairs to get dressed
for the afternoon or to go out, and also of telling
her at the same time what message was
to be given at the door, so as not to keep any
one waiting, was impressed on her.</p>

<p class='c020'>She was told that she should rise when
spoken to by any of the family or guests; also
it was explained to her that she was to do the
duties of the chambermaid when the chambermaid
was out.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Her daily work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Be up early, throw mattress and bedclothes
over the foot of your bed to air.</p>

<p class='c020'>After dressing, open windows top and bottom
in your room, put pillows near window
to air, closing the door of your room and always
of any room you are airing (if the family
is up), so as not to chill the rest of the
house.</p>

<p class='c020'>On your way downstairs open windows top
and bottom in the part of the house which is
in your charge, closing them after your breakfast
in time for the dining-room to get warm
for the family breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>Your breakfast being over, set the family
breakfast table, and if there is not time for
dusting before their breakfast, quickly put
back into place anything that has been put out
of order the night before and make the room
look comfortable.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there has been a fire the night before, lay
a fresh one ready to light and brush up the
hearth.</p>

<p class='c020'>Set the breakfast table, announce breakfast
at the specified hour, and serve it.</p>

<p class='c020'>When breakfast is over, wash all breakfast
things and leave the pantry in perfect
order.</p>

<p class='c020'>Then begin the care of the rooms under
your charge.</p>

<p class='c020'>Pick up any scraps on carpet with carpet
sweeper and go over the wooden floor with a
dustless mop.</p>

<p class='c020'>Dust window sills and all pieces of furniture,
using two dust cloths, one to hold the
furniture so that your hand will not leave a
mark on it, and the other to dust with.</p>

<p class='c020'>Empty scrap baskets and take contents
downstairs.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there are lamps, trim and clean them,
wiping carefully the outside of the lamp and
burner with damp cloth so that no oil will be
left to make it smell.</p>

<p class='c020'>Brush down stairs, holding dustpan under
each step and wiping woodwork carefully.</p>

<p class='c020'>Then begin the special morning work for that
day, such as cleaning parlor, dining-room and
pantry, silver, halls and library, or brasses.</p>

<p class='c020'>This work should be accomplished in plenty
of time to set the lunch table without hurry.</p>

<p class='c020'>Announce lunch at the usual hour, and after
it has been served and you have had your
own and washed the lunch things, dress yourself
for the afternoon in a neat black dress
with fresh white apron and plain linen collar
and be ready at three-thirty to wait on the
door.</p>

<p class='c020'>If you haven’t had a chance before this,
polish the steel knives with knife polish and
board that comes for the purpose so that they
will be bright for dinner.</p>

<p class='c020'>Be ready to serve tea promptly in the afternoon
if desired by your mistress.</p>

<p class='c020'>As it gets dark, draw down the shades,
light the regular lights that your mistress has
specified, and set the table for dinner in time
to do it nicely, announcing it at the appointed
hour, waiting on it, and then taking your own
dinner. After your dinner, remove whatever
is left on the table; take off, fold up, and put
away tablecloth; wash the dishes, and leave
pantry in nice order.</p>

<p class='c020'>If there are no guests, take in the doormat,
close and lock front door and any windows
desired by your mistress, at the hour appointed
by her.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Miscellaneous notes for the waitress Washing dishes, etc.</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>In washing the dishes, always do the cleanest
things first, in this order; glass, silver;
then cups and saucers, plates, and other dishes.
Empty every glass and cup, and scrape clean
every plate or dish (with a plate scraper, that
comes with a rubber edge and is consequently
noiseless), before putting them in the water.
Don’t let pitchers or glasses stand with milk
in them, but rinse them at once before putting
them in the water so that it will be easy
to wash them. Don’t put many things into
the water at a time or different kinds of things,
such as teapot, sauce boat, and dinner plates;
for the water will cool too quickly when so
full and the plates will get chipped and spouts
broken. Change the water frequently. When
washing the silver, always include trays in
daily use even if they do not seem soiled. Use
plenty of fresh very hot suds, and, after washing
the silver well, put it on the drainer and
pour boiling hot water over it. This heat will
almost dry it, then rub <i>quickly</i> with clean dish-cloth
and put all the pieces at once where they
belong before they can get spattered; setting
them down with a dish towel to prevent finger
marks. This will keep the silver so bright
that the weekly cleaning is a much easier
matter. The china should be rinsed just as
you have the silver, only not using such very
hot water. Remember that silver and brasses
cannot be made bright by slow rubbing, but
that you must rub them briskly.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Care of the dining-table</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>If the dining-table has a high polish, be
careful always to put a tile or tray or a linen
mat lined with asbestos under anything that
is hot, otherwise a bad spot will be made. If
the table has an oil finish heat will not injure
it and a damp cloth will remove any spot.
Two or three times a week such a dining-table
should be rubbed over well with a soft cloth
on which two or three drops of boiled linseed
oil have been put. Too much oil will only
make the table sticky and in condition to catch
dust. But just a very little, rubbed in well,
will, in time, give it a high polish of which
you will be proud. These oiled rags are very
dangerous to keep in the house, as they catch
fire of themselves without any flame coming
near them. Either keep them hanging on a
clothes-line in the yard or else indoors in a
metal box.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c020'>The weekly duties in detail, such as the
thorough cleaning of dining-room, parlor,
pantry, halls, silver, brasses, etc., and the
Sunday arrangements and afternoons and
evenings out, should appear here at the end
of the waitress’s book, but, as I said before,
I cannot put it in for you because that is something
you have to arrange for yourself.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Description of the cook’s book</i><br /><i>Her general work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Under this head the cook was told definitely
just what rooms, closets, halls, steps, etc., she
was expected to clean; whether she was expected
to put any coal on the furnace or look
after its drafts between the visits of the furnace
man; whether she had any washing and ironing
to do; how careful she should be to scrub
out every part of the refrigerator once or twice
a week with soda and hot water, household
ammonia, or some such thing, airing it well
afterwards and taking the opportunity before
a fresh piece of ice was put in thoroughly to
clean out the ice compartment; also the drain
pipe for that compartment with a brush that
comes especially for this; also that she should
be careful to empty the pan under the refrigerator
frequently to prevent its overflowing and
rotting the floor; that the milk and butter
should be kept in a compartment by themselves,
and no food with strong odor, such as
pineapples or melons, be put in the refrigerator
with it as their flavor would be absorbed
by the milk and butter which would
taste bad in consequence; also that no hot
food or articles wrapped in paper should be
put into the refrigerator. She was cautioned
not to let any scraps get into the sink pipes,
but to scrape clean all plates, pots, or dishes
after each meal, into a strainer kept for the
purpose in the corner of the sink and frequently
emptied into the garbage, and that
once a week she should wash down the pipes
with boiling water and lye. She was reminded
that the kitchen towels should be washed in
hot suds every day and thoroughly boiled once
a week; that the pudding-bags or any straining-cloths
should be washed after each using
and put away dry and clean.</p>

<p class='c020'>It was especially impressed upon her to
keep the dumb waiter shut and any door that
would allow the kitchen odors to get into the
house.</p>

<p class='c020'>The signals to the waitress during the serving
of the meals were explained to her (for
instance, one bell for taking course off the
range, two bells to send to pantry) to prevent
delay between courses; also she was told that
hot food should be served on a warm platter
and cold food on a cold one. In order to serve
the meals promptly on time, she was reminded
to see every day whether her clock agreed with
her master’s. The fact that the ovens would
not bake well unless the flues of the range
were cleared at least once a week of all ashes,
and that this should be done in the morning
before the range fire was hot, was explained to
her; also that when a hot fire was not needed
for immediate use the dampers and drafts
should be closed to prevent waste of coal and
kindlings. She was cautioned not to waste
anything, but to lay aside all left-over food for
her mistress to see and decide about; also not
to use the nice china when putting food away
in the refrigerator, for fear it might get broken.
The importance of being neat and clean both
in her cooking and person, washing her hands
before handling food, and wearing neat cotton
aprons and dresses was emphasized. She was
told that no visitors should be allowed in the
kitchen during meals and that she should not
let workmen, etc., go into the house except
by permission of her mistress and accompanied
by one of the other maids whom she
should notify; also that the responsibility of
keeping the outside kitchen door and gate
locked was hers as well as the locking-up of
her department at night.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Her daily work</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>On getting up, throw mattress and bedclothes
over the foot of your bed to air.</p>

<p class='c020'>After dressing, open windows top and bottom
in your room, putting pillows near window
to air and closing the door of your room
so as not to chill the house.</p>

<p class='c020'>Have the range fire going in time to have
plenty of hot water for the family baths.</p>

<p class='c020'>The range fire burning brightly, prepare
the maids’ breakfast (if that comes first) and
put the family cereal on to cook during your
meal and anything else that requires long
cooking.</p>

<p class='c020'>Cook the family breakfast.</p>

<p class='c020'>After both breakfasts are over, put the
kitchen in order and be ready to take your
mistress’s orders for the day, going with her
to the ice-chest and showing her the left-overs
there and in the wire safe.</p>

<p class='c020'>When your mistress comes into the kitchen,
rise and remain standing while she is there.</p>

<p class='c020'>When her visit is over, make your first
duty the preparing and serving of food well
and on time, the other duties being fitted in
between, till the last meal is over and the time
has come to arrange the kitchen for the night,
when you should put away all food in the
refrigerator or wire safe, wipe the tables off,
brush up the hearth, and leave nothing to attract
mice or water-bugs or near enough the
stove to catch fire.</p>

<p class='c020'>If the range fire is made new every day,
place kindlings, coal, and paper in a convenient
place ready for use before going to bed, to
avoid delay in the morning, and before leaving
the kitchen see that all windows, doors,
and gates in your department are securely
locked.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Miscellaneous notes for cook—Making the range fire if it is never allowed to go out</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>About half an hour before leaving the
kitchen for the night, put coal on, open the
drafts, and, when the fire is hot, fill up well
with coal, then check the drafts and leave
them checked so that the fire will smoulder
all night. In the morning, open the drafts,
shake down the grate, put on a little kindling
and fresh coal, and the fire will burn brightly
in a short time.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Making the range fire if started fresh every morning</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Shake the ashes out thoroughly, picking
out pieces of coal only partly burned to be
used again and putting ashes in ash can to
be taken away. Put loose rolls of paper in,
then kindlings laid crosswise and far enough
apart for a draft of air to go through freely,
then light the papers, turning the dampers to
make a draft. When the kindlings are burning
well, put the coal on in small quantities
at first, adding more when this is well started.</p>

<p class='c020'>Before starting the first fire after the house
has been closed, burn newspapers in the range
to warm the chimney and thus prevent its
smoking by starting an upward draft.</p>

<p class='c020'>Sunday arrangements, also afternoons and
evenings out in detail, should come here.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c028'>CHAPTER VIII <span class='c008'>⬩</span> BEHIND THE<br />SCENES AT A DINNER&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;❧</h2>
</div>
<div class='c009'><span class='sc'>York Harbor</span>, <i>October 15</i>.</div>
<p class='c010'><i>Penelope Pennington</i>!</p>
<p class='c011'>What is this that you tell me!
<i>You</i> are to have charge of a formal dinner
for your Aunt Sally! How perfectly
dear it is of her to give one to Mr. and
Mrs. Winslow in appreciation of Tom’s
promotion. I have been to many of your
aunt’s dinners in the past and know how
smoothly she will want everything to
go, so I am not surprised at your excitement
at the thought of making all the
arrangements for her, and I am very
glad that she feels strong enough to be
present herself. I understand from your
letter that you do not wish for a menu, as
you want to choose that yourself, or for
any directions about wines, as you can
find all that in cookery books, but you do
want to know about preparations “behind
the scenes,” as it were, to make
everything go like clockwork. First,
foremost, and last I am evidently to
drop everything and write you at once!
Do you realize, dear child, that I am off,
in a few days, on that motor trip through
the Berkshires about which I wrote you?
But since it is for <i>you</i>, I will stop my
preparations for a little and write this if
it takes me all night!</p>

<p class='c011'>To set a household like your aunt’s
going for such an affair, after it has been
shut off from social life for so long, is
almost like starting with untrained servants,
so I shall give you directions in
minute detail. Since you can’t tell yet
whether it is to be a dinner of eight or
twelve, I will write a description for one
of eight complete and then describe in
general terms the difference between the
two.</p>

<p class='c011'>It will be delightful to engineer the
dinner without a moment’s worry about
expense, knowing that your aunt is so
perfectly well able to afford it. People
who make such attempts when they cannot
afford it deserve all the worry that
they suffer. Others always know that
they are attempting something beyond
their means and they lose, in a measure,
the respect of the very people whom
they have tried to impress. About the
only difference from one’s everyday dinner
is that nothing is served on the table
and the courses are more in number, and
it is well to impress this on the minds
of your aunt’s servants. Don’t let the
thought of a dinner mean only hard work
to them, but let them feel sure of having
plenty of ice-cream, cake, candy,
etc., afterwards, so that there can be a
festive feeling downstairs as well as up.
There is a good deal of extra work, and
also late hours, in connection with a dinner
of this kind and the servants deserve
some encouragement and reward.</p>

<p class='c011'>Several days before the dinner make
out the menu from the dishes that the
cook makes the best, not attempting anything
new. Give her confidence by consulting
her a little, and also encourage
her by praising the way she cooks these
special dishes, at the same time cautioning
her on the necessity of great care
on such an occasion and of keeping her
reputation up. See that she has the
proper kitchen utensils needed in good
order for use. Then go over each dish
in a good receipt book putting down on
a writing-pad exactly what is needed
for each course, how much milk, butter,
eggs, cream, seasoning, vegetables, meat,
etc.</p>

<p class='c011'>Your menu having been decided upon
with the cook, then go over, with the
waitress, the china, glass, silver, etc., to
see if there are eight of everything unbroken
for each course. Jot down on a
memorandum what broken pieces, if
any, have to be replaced. Go over the
silver and decide how you will use that.
Don’t make a great undertaking of this,
but do it quickly. It won’t take long.
Decide, at this time, what flowers you
will have and what color scheme, and
see if the candle shades are in good
order and that there are enough candles.
Once having done all this, should your
aunt want you to take charge of a dinner
for her again, the waitress, if she is
reliable, can do this part herself and report
to you if anything is needed. See
that the broken china and glass are replaced
several days before the dinner.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now that you have decided on the
menu, and what china, glass, silver, and
candle shades you intend using, you can
write out the directions for the waitress
for serving the dinner, putting opposite
each course what plates and platters you
want used for that course and have these
directions ready to pin up in the pantry.
I cannot say too much about getting
everything off your mind that you can
the day before the dinner. On this day,
in order to keep the cook calm, see for
yourself that all the necessary articles,
except very perishable ones, are in the
house, and have her prepare the clear
soup and anything else that she can on
that day. Take this time to tell her (or
to show her pictures from cookery books)
how you like to have the dishes decorated,
and also remind her that one signal (or
bell) from the pantry means to dish up
and keep a course hot, and two signals
(or bells) to send it up to the pantry,
and caution her how a few minutes’ delay
in the kitchen seems a long time in
the dining-room, so she has to be quick.
Write out the menu very clearly for
her and pin it up in the kitchen, and then
decide on the platters and dishes to be
used. In fact, have all your conversation
with her about the dinner the day before.
Write the place cards. (Plain blank
cards are dignified and answer the purpose
just as well as fancy, elaborate
ones which are expensive, and the money
saved can go toward pretty flowers that
will really add to the beauty of the table
and the pleasure of the guests.) Find
out the day before the dinner just how
your aunt wishes the guests to be seated
and write this down, so that it will only
take a moment when the table is set to
put the cards at their proper places.
(Of course Mr. and Mrs. Winslow being
the guests of honor, Tom will take
in Mrs. Winslow, who will sit at his
right, and Mr. Winslow will take your
aunt in and sit at her right.) At the
same time address the little envelopes
that come for the purpose, one for each
man guest, and slip into them the card
with the name of the lady he is to take
in to dinner. Keep all these things in a
sideboard drawer to be on hand when
you want them.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the case of this first formal dinner
with your aunt’s present servants, you
will have to be on the spot most of the
morning if you want to take a rest in the
afternoon. You can give the dining-room
up to the dinner that day and lunch at a
side-table or in the library. After your
short interview of encouragement with
the cook, you read to the waitress and
chambermaid the directions for serving
the dinner and see that they understand
their parts in it, and try to make them
ambitious that everything should go well
and be a credit to them. You then pin
these directions up in the pantry. These
directions can be used for many dinners
until they are worn out. After this you
superintend putting on the under-pad
and then the tablecloth which must be
very smooth. The chambermaid must
help the waitress, as it takes two to put on
a large cloth without mussing it. Watch
the waitress put the eight plates around
the table, to be sure they are evenly
spaced (two on each side, if the table is
wide enough; otherwise with eight there
must be a gentleman at the head and
another at the foot in order not to have
two gentlemen or two ladies side by side).
Next have the waitress set one place completely,
under your directions, with small
silver, glasses, and napkins as in the
family dinner (only more, as the courses
require<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c029'><sup>[1]</sup></a>), so that she can set all the
places like it without your being there to
direct her. Leave her to put fresh candles
in the candlesticks, and a final polish
on the china, silver, and glass that are
to be used during the dinner, while you
arrange the flowers. No matter how
nicely any one keeps house, there is a
great deal for the servants to think of for
a dinner, and as they have never served
one for you before, should you get the
impression in the morning that things are
not going on very well, you will have to
be in the dining-room a good deal, quietly
seeing that no time is lost.</p>
<div class='footnote c030' id='f1'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If you don’t like so many forks and knives on
the table at once, put enough for the first three courses
and have the others brought on with the plates of each
course as in the case of dessert.</p>
</div>

<p class='c019'>After the lunch things have been
cleared off and the servants have had their
lunch, you superintend the setting of the
side-table with the extra things that will
be needed during the dinner, such as the
plates for cold courses, any small silver
that may be needed, a plate for the extra
bread and rolls, and all the plates for the
last course, on each of which is a doily,
and a finger bowl one third full of water.
All these things should be prettily arranged
in a symmetrical manner, and if
there isn’t room on the side-table some
can go on the sideboard, as they must
all be convenient.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the side-table is set, you can go
with the waitress into the pantry and have
her send down to the kitchen all platters,
dishes, etc., that are to be served from
there and arrange, in a corner of the
pantry out of the way and in piles, the
plates for the different courses, putting
on each pile a slip of paper telling what
course it is for, so that the servants won’t
get confused. See that the tray of after-dinner
coffee-cups is arranged in the
pantry with a spoon on each saucer, and
with the sugar tongs on the bowl of sugar.
Then go and rest and come down later
when the waitress reports to you that she
has finished setting the dining-table. You
will probably find that it doesn’t look to
your satisfaction, but don’t put the servants
out of temper with criticisms. Take
it for granted that they have done their
best, speak well of what is right, and
straighten out what is wrong with explanations,
giving the finishing touches
yourself. Then should your aunt give
any more dinners under your supervision,
her servants could do most of this themselves.
After the dinner is over, and the
guests are gone, be generous in your
praise to the servants of everything that
went well and wait for another time to
show how to correct any mistakes that
were made. They will probably go to bed
very tired that night, but happy because
they have pleased you.</p>

<p class='c020'>Here are the details for the dinner:—</p>

<p class='c020'>When you post your written directions
in the pantry, it is well to underline the
<i>waitress’s</i> with red pencil, the <i>chambermaid’s</i>
with blue, so that each can
see at a glance where her duty comes
in.</p>

<p class='c020'>The signals to be used to send the
courses up at a dinner have to be carefully
understood beforehand between the
servants in the dining-room and kitchen.
Generally it gives the cook about the
right time if, when the first guest has
finished, the chambermaid rings one bell
for her to dish and keep the course hot,
and when more than half the guests have
finished, two bells to send to the pantry.
This depends, however, so much on the
quickness of the servants, etc., that they
have to learn gradually, by experience,
the proper time interval between bells.
The standard of perfection to aspire to, is
no waiting between courses and no hurrying
during courses.</p>

<p class='c020'>After the first two courses I will give
you but few details, because in serving
every course the following general
method is to be observed:—</p>

<p class='c020'>The same signs and signals are passed
at the proper time between waitress,
chambermaid, and cook for removing and
bringing on every course.</p>

<p class='c020'>In <i>every</i> course where there is a main
dish and two other dishes, the chambermaid
(after having taken all the soiled
plates from the waitress and in return
given her all the fresh ones) gives the
main dish to the waitress and then follows
her all around the table with a dish
in each hand offering first one, then the
other, to every guest.</p>

<p class='c020'>Soiled plates are <i>always</i> replaced with
fresh ones from the <i>right</i> side of each
person, and all foods are <i>always</i> offered
on the <i>left</i> side. The lady on the <i>right</i> of
the host is served first.</p>

<p class='c020'>During <i>every</i> course, where there is
but <i>one thing</i> to pass, the chambermaid
remains in the pantry, handing out and
taking in plates and keeping the pantry
in order.</p>

<p class='c020'>One course is <i>always</i> entirely removed
into the pantry before another course is
brought on.</p>

<p class='c020'>Let us take the following dinner as an
example:—</p>
<div class='lg-container-l c032'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>First course, canapé.</div>

<p class='c022'>You can omit either canapé or entrée
or both if you prefer.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><span class='sc'>Dinner of Eight served by Three Servants</span></h3>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c024'>
    <div><i>Directions for the two dining-room servants</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'><i>Fifteen minutes</i> before the hour for dinner,
the chambermaid, in neat black dress, with
cap, plain white collar and cuffs, and apron,
all immaculately clean and fresh, sees that
the lights are lighted in the dressing-room,
and stands ready to help the ladies off with
their wraps. When they have all arrived and
have left the dressing-room, she turns down
the light and goes right to the dining-room
ready to help the waitress.</p>

<p class='c020'><i>Fifteen minutes</i> before the hour for dinner,
the waitress, after having lighted the lights
on the parlor floor and in the front hall stands
at the front door watching to open it promptly
to prevent any guest from having to ring the
bell. She helps the gentlemen off with their
coats, hangs up their hats, places their canes
in the rack, and hands them the tray on which
the card envelopes have been placed. When all
the guests have arrived, the chambermaid signals
the cook this fact, then fills the glasses with
iced water, while the waitress lights the candles
on the dining-table. Then both bring in
quickly the plates of canapé, placing them on
the serving plates already at each place.</p>

<p class='c020'>The chambermaid then goes into the pantry.
When this is done, the waitress gives a last
look to see that nothing has been forgotten
and that the candles are all burning well, and
goes quietly into the parlor and says in a low
voice, “Dinner is served, Mrs. ——.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>First course—canapé</i><a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c029'><sup>[2]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote c030' id='f2'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r2'>2</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This can be brought in after the guests are seated,
like the other courses, if preferred.</p>
</div>
<p class='c033'>which is on the table when the guests come
into the dining-room. When the first guest
has finished this course, the waitress makes
a silent sign to the chambermaid, who is in
the pantry, and she signals to the cook (one
bell), which means that the next course is to
be dished up and kept hot. When more than
half of the guests have finished, the waitress
makes a silent sign to the chambermaid
again, who signals (two bells) to the cook,
which means to send up the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Second course—soup</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>When the soup comes into the pantry the
chambermaid fills all the plates half full and
hands a plate to the waitress, who comes to
the pantry door for it. The waitress takes the
plate in her <i>right</i> hand and goes to the <i>right</i>
side of the lady on the <i>right</i> of the host,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c029'><sup>[3]</sup></a> and
picking up the used canapé plate with her <i>left</i>
hand, replaces it, on the serving plate, with
the plate of soup. She then watches and, as
each guest finishes, she replaces the canapé
plate with a plate of soup, the chambermaid
standing inside the pantry door ready to take
the used plate and to hand her the soup plate.
As soon as all have soup, the waitress passes
any accompaniment, on a small tray, all around
the table, while the chambermaid remains in
the pantry to straighten and keep it in order.</p>
<div class='footnote c030' id='f3'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Many people have everything passed first to the
hostess. This is a matter of taste.</p>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><i>Third course—fish in ramekins on individual plates</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>This is brought on and served the same as
the soup, but in removing it the waitress replaces
each fish plate with an empty hot plate,
and then the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Fourth course—the entrée</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>is brought on by the waitress who holds the
casserole or platter with both hands under it
and passes it in regular order all around the
table. This course having been removed and
fresh hot plates having replaced the used
ones, the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Fifth course—the roast</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>is brought on. The waitress passes the roast
all around the table and the chambermaid follows
with a dish of vegetables in each hand,
which she offers on the <i>left</i> side of each person
in turn till all have been served. Anything
else in this course is passed all around
in the same way by the chambermaid. If the
dish is large, it should be carried in her
hands; if small, on a tray. The waitress then
watches to fill glasses and pass rolls. Having
done this, the chambermaid returns to the
pantry and when the roast course has been
removed and fresh plates have been substituted
for used ones, she hands the waitress the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Sixth course—the salad</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>following her all around the table with whatever
accompaniment there may be and then
returning to the pantry. In removing this
course the waitress takes two plates at a time,
one in each hand (<i>never</i> on top of each other),
and does not replace them with other plates.
When this course is completely removed, the
waitress brings a tray and, going around the
table, takes off peppers and salts and any
small silver or knives that are left there, and
takes them to the pantry, being very careful
not to make the slightest noise. The chambermaid
follows with a folded napkin and silver
tray and removes the crumbs. Then the
chambermaid returns to the pantry, and the
waitress, bringing in each hand a dessert
plate with fork and spoon on it; places them
in turn before each person, setting them down
from the right side. She then takes the dessert
platter from the chambermaid in the pantry
and brings on the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Seventh course—dessert</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>and passes it all around the table, the chambermaid
following with cake. When this
course is removed and the dessert plates are
replaced by plates with finger bowls, the waitress
passes the</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c025'>
    <div><i>Eighth course—candy</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c034'>placing the little dishes of different kinds on
a tray. While the guests are at this course the
chambermaid sees that the fire in the parlor
burns brightly and the lights are all turned
up, and when all have finished dinner and
have gone into the parlor, she passes the coffee
and cigars to the gentlemen in the dining-room
or library, while the waitress passes the
coffee to the ladies in the parlor. When the
gentlemen, after smoking, join the ladies in
the parlor, the waitress passes, on a tray,
glasses which she fills with ice-cold Apollinaris
or White Rock, and offers to each guest.
When the guests are about to leave, the waitress,
on the first signal of the parlor bell, goes
to the front door to help the gentlemen on
with their coats, hand them their canes and
hats, and open the front door, while the
chambermaid is in the dressing-room ready
to help the ladies on with their wraps.</p>

    <div><i>Special notes for chambermaid at dinner of eight</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>After having helped the waitress put the
canapé on the table, return to the pantry,
where your duties are:</p>

<p class='c020'>To signal the cook when signed by the
waitress to do so.</p>

<p class='c020'>To keep the pantry from getting into confusion,
by piling used plates out of the way
and sending platters down to the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c020'>To be ready to take used plates from the
waitress instantly and hand her the ones for
the next course, and where there is more than
one dish served at a course to hand the main
dish to the waitress and follow her into the
dining-room with the lesser dishes, passing
them around just after the waitress and then
returning to the pantry.</p>

<p class='c020'>To see that the plates are warm for hot
courses and cold for cold ones.</p>

<p class='c020'>To follow the waitress when she is removing
salts and peppers, and take up the crumbs.</p>

<p class='c020'>To go into the parlor while the guests are
at the last course and see that the fire burns
brightly and that the lights are turned up.</p>

<p class='c020'>To return to the pantry, and when coffee
comes up to pour it into the cups and give
one tray to the waitress to serve the ladies and
take the other yourself to the gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c020'>To help the waitress wash up the dishes
after the dinner.</p>

<p class='c020'>To answer the doorbell should it ring while
dinner is being served.</p>

<p class='c020'>To be ready on the first signal of the parlor
bell to go into the ladies’ dressing-room
and help them on with their wraps.</p>
<h3 class='c021'><i>Dinner of twelve</i></h3>

<p class='c022'>Should the dinner turn out to be one
of twelve instead of eight, it will make a
difference in your arrangements, because,
while the preparations made before and
after the actual dinner are identical with
those made for a dinner of eight, yet certain
changes are necessary in the service;
namely, the chambermaid should be relieved
that day from doing her weekly
cleaning, and, as soon as the bedrooms
are finished, she should help either the
cook or waitress as they may need her;
also some one will be required in the
kitchen to assist the cook, and some one
to come about half an hour before the
dinner to stay in the pantry and do there
what the chambermaid did in the dinner
of eight, except that she does not come
out of the pantry during the dinner, and
therefore the two waiting on the table are
not obliged to go into the pantry. The
courses are passed and removed in the
same way as in the dinner of eight, except
that there are two to do it instead of
one, and therefore to avoid collision it is
well for one to take one side of the table
and the other the other side, in the courses
where this is possible. In the case of the
entrée or dessert, two platters are often
used to make it go quicker, the waitress
beginning with the lady on the right
of the host and ending with the hostess
and the chambermaid beginning with the
guest on the right of the hostess and ending
with the host. After the dessert all
the arrangements are the same as in a
dinner for eight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c026'>
    <div><i>Directions for the maid in the pantry at a dinner of twelve</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'><i>Fifteen minutes before</i> the dinner, go into
the pantry, shut the door, and fill the sink
with hot water, so that in case you need to
rinse anything off during the dinner you can
do it without noise. Remember that every
sound can be heard in the dining-room, so
be very careful not to make the slightest
noise in handling the silver and china and to
move the dumb waiter up and down very
quietly and slowly. Be ready, when the waitress
hands you the plates that have been
used, to hand her back instantly the fresh
plates for the next course till all are handed
out, and to ring one bell to signal the cook
the first time the waitress makes a sign to
you to do it, and two bells the second time
she gives you this sign. When you have
handed all the plates out for a course, give
out the main dish for that course at once,
handing immediately afterwards the dishes
that go with the course; as, for example,
fresh hot plates first, then the roast, followed
quickly with the two vegetables, always putting
on each platter and in the vegetable
dishes the necessary spoons, forks, or knives.
Remember that hot dishes must have warm
plates and cold dishes cold ones.</p>

<p class='c020'>As soon as you receive from the waitresses
the platters and dishes of any finished course,
send them down to the kitchen and occupy
any time that you have, while a course is
going on in the dining-room, in piling plates
out of the way in order not to have them litter
up the pantry where you will need all the
space you can get during the dinner. Don’t
let this or anything else interfere with handing
a course promptly. When the coffee comes
up from the kitchen, fill all the cups on the
two trays and hand them to the waitresses.<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c029'><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<div class='footnote c030' id='f4'>
<p class='c031'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It is best to have the soup sent from the kitchen
to the pantry in a pitcher, as it keeps hotter and can
be more quickly poured into plates.</p>
</div>
<p class='c014'>I am afraid, Penelope, that you will
think there is a great deal of detail
in these dinner directions, but my own
dislike of detail is just what leads me to
write it out so fully for you, so that you
can have it on paper, in your housekeeping
book, instead of keeping it in your
mind. My experience, too, is that you
cannot be too explicit when instructing
servants to whom you are not accustomed,
and these very details, once written
out and left for them to consult, will
enable you to make all your preparations
for other dinners with ease before
the day and leave you on that day free
to pay your visits and lead your normal
life, only coming in toward the end of
the afternoon to make a final inspection
to see that everything is right. You can
see how confident I am that your aunt,
once having felt the pleasure of opening
her house again, will want to do it frequently.</p>

<hr class='c023' />

<p class='c011'>What a variety of subjects we have
been over together in these letters! I
can’t imagine what next you can ask me
unless it be advice on the management
of a young and attractive husband, and
happily I shall escape that by flight!
Don’t imagine, Penelope, dear, that I
think I have smoothed out the whole
domestic situation for you, for I cannot
do much more than try to give you
principles to work on, hoping that you
and your bright young women friends
will discuss it rationally together in order
that you may meet the problem more
wisely and broadly and in a more human
spirit than our generation has done. The
world moves and we must move along
with it, but we can have no better rule
to go by in facing <i>any</i> conditions than
the one given us over nineteen hundred
years ago, “Whatsoever ye would that
men should do unto you, even so do ye
also unto them.”</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Au revoir</i>, dear; think of my actually
being able to go off on a pleasure trip!
You can imagine how full of excitement
I am over it, for I couldn’t have done
this a year ago, and couldn’t now if it
weren’t for my delightful relatives who
are making everything so smooth and
easy for me.</p>

<p class='c011'><i>Au revoir</i>, love to Tom and success to
that exciting dinner. I shall hope to hear
all about it when I come back.</p>
<p class='c012'>Very affectionately yours,</p>
